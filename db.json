It may be cheap but if you want to live in a good location with swimming pool, go to nice rooftops and restaurants, use taxis then it is similar cost to western countries. In many areas there are no sidewalks, big and dangerous traffic all the time, pollution, taxis do not want to go with meter, it can get really hot. Definitely try to live by the metro. Many foreigners, mostly friendly people, cheap flights to visit the region, good food. Bangkok atmosphere is unique.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Chiang Mai has had a deep Buddhist influence running over the last 1,000 years and this can be felt in the helpfulness, patience and generosity of the Thai and long-term transplants you come across. The city has an active community scene (nomads, spiritual seekers, hikers, creatives), several mountains with hiking spots and waterfalls surrounding the city, over 20 water bodies inside the city -- many have cafes and walks around, several public parks, and over 13 national parks with campgrounds within a 2hr drive. New cafes / art spaces are opening up every other week. Also, many temples that disseminate Buddhist teachings and run mindfulness retreats near and around the city. The nervous system of Chiang Mai is a relaxing one - the city often feels as an open space without walls.  Burning season ( Feb - Apr) sees an AQI of 200+ and either requires you to stay indoors or travel elsewhere. May/June are on the hotter side, and July - Sep sees an average rainfall of an hour a day. Oct to Jan is a cool season with Dec to early Feb being the blooming season. While each season brings a different flavor with it, Chiang Mai is a paradise throughout excepting the burning season period.  Other notes: English proficiency of the local population is basic. Old city is walking friendly and has many quiet spots, Nimman is the westerner friendly spot and also sees high traffic, Pong Noi is more artsy / hippie.  ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Great city! Buenos Aires feels like a European capital located in Latin America (at roughly half the cost).  Lots of cafes, restaurants, bars, clubs, shops, and etc. Uber and ride-share apps are very responsive & inexpensive here, but they are also not the greatest cars. The public transportation is also good. The language exchange events here are the best I have seen, heard of, or been to for those who are trying to learn languages or network with a wide variety of locals and internationals.  Overall, I felt pretty safe here walking around the city (walked everywhere) and never had an issue with safety. However, my disclaimer is I stayed in Palermo Hollywood, and spent most of my time in Belgrano, Palermo, Recoletta, San Telmo, and Downtown (safe areas).  There is a lot to do in Buenos Aires, the social life is very good. For nomads, there are a lot of whatsapp groups you can join to learn about group/social events to join. For those who want to learn how to dance, this is definitely one of the best spots in the world -- they have lessons every night and tons of men and women attend.  This is a DOG city, tons of dogs and their humans at the parks or walking around the city.  This is also a mosquito city, buy repellent as soon as you land and put it on immediately.  The people here are pretty friendly and very social. ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "I was here in early 2024 for 2 months, and things have improved as far as availability of monthly apt hotels on a monthly basis.   Probably because a lot of new buildings have opened so price competition is pushing down the higher rents a bit.   I found a few large studios at around 1k per month, at apt hotels in the central KLCC area, and one small 1bed at 750 per. month. These are luxury apts, fully staffed reception during the day (staff leaves at 8 or 9 PM), 24 hour security, a gym and pool.   If you don't mind staying outside of KLCC, and the other 'hot' areas, luxury apts can be found at even lower costs. Grab is the uber of SE Asia, and it's inexpensive and not difficult to get around in KL. Locals are mostly nice, but don't expect the effusive exuberance of the Balinese. The Malaysians are quieter, and a bit more shy, but lovely overall. English being the primary language makes it easier for native English speakers, but  it's not American or British English, so there are challenges sometimes, because common things are referred to in different words then what other cultures use, making it difficult to understand for sure what is meant.  There are a few yoga studios, meditation places, and good restaurants. If you're into exploring the food scene, it won't be so boring, at least shorter term.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Warsaw, as a destination for digital nomads, presents a mixed bag of experiences. It's often praised for its affordability, good quality of life, and excellent infrastructure, including fast internet and walkable neighborhoods【8†source】【7†source】. However, it's also characterized by a bustling atmosphere, high traffic, and an ongoing political agenda that some find off-putting.  While many digital nomads and locals have found a home in Warsaw, it's worth noting that this city may not be everyone's first choice. Many reside here out of necessity, due to work or university commitments. This is not to say that Warsaw lacks charm or potential; it's just that it takes time to grow on you. The city's culture, like its architecture, is often described as \"brutalist\", and it can take up to three years of living there to fully integrate and form a strong social network.  Nevertheless, there are aspects of Warsaw that are beloved by its residents. Enthusiasts of brutalist architecture will find much to admire in the cityscape, and the Vistula river offers delightful kayaking opportunities. The city is also home to a vibrant restaurant scene, although these establishments can be crowded and often require waiting for a table. Prices can be steep, and while the quality of the food is generally high, some establishments may not live up to their hype.  In comparison, cities like Kraków, Gdańsk, and Gdynia, along with smaller towns in Southern Poland, are often considered more appealing to digital nomads. These locations offer a slower pace of life, less crowding, and a more relaxed atmosphere, making them preferable for those who value tranquility and close-knit communities over the hustle and bustle of the capital.  In conclusion, while Warsaw has its merits, it is not a city that appeals to everyone. Its crowdedness, high traffic, and political climate can be off-putting to some. However, for those who are willing to look past these aspects and give it time, Warsaw can offer a unique and rewarding experience. As always, your mileage may vary, and it's recommended to visit before making a commitment.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Hello i am agreed with previous comment . I was very passionate about Portugal pend here two and half years even more just living living here , not travel abroad . So my opinion its very beautiful country people are also very nice . Ideally if you working abroad . British and French expats are here . Nepal people hard workers and afro colonies people who came from Mozambique .  Its totally fine no racism and totally solidarity . But , if you searching housing , and move in city of course , it will be always problematic , night out markets works definitely on the weekends . Its slowest country about everything , so be very patient about it . No expect too much about it . Definitely for city lovers no recommend . Theaters and Cultural festas are no popular .  Prices for Housing as the same as in Paris London . You can free chill on the beach or you can follow Nomad trend life .     ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Lived in Prague for 8 years. It's a beautiful international European city. Never learned Czech, but was fine. Almost all cafes and restaurants have English menus. Superb food delivery apps (Wolt is the best). All the food you can imagine. Vietnamese food is world-class because of the huge Vietnamese population. If you want hipster bars and cafes, there's plenty of that. If you want old-world-charm there's plenty of that. If you want posh luxury there's some of Europes best restaurants and cocktail bars here.  Still very good value for eating and drinking out. But the housing has gotten a lot more expensive. In the end I spent half on my income every month on rent. And you don't want to live in the dead suburbs. But if you can find a good deal in the center you'll be fine. You can walk everywhere. The public transport is excellent in the rare occasions you need it.  It's a walkable and livable city with an extraordinary amount of beautiful architecture and bridges. It's also very green, lots of trees and parks both big and small. Prague is also one of the safest cities in the world, almost feels like a small town in this regard.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Lived in Copenhagen for just under three years, and for the whole time, I have worked remotely as a freelancer. It's pretty much as perfect as you're going to get in terms of urban design; getting around is easy and safe by bike, and the public transport network is efficient and reasonably-priced. Lots of fun things to do for a relatively small city, and the locals are—from personal experience—incredibly friendly.   Pros:  - Very safe. You can walk around most areas round-the-clock and not have to worry, violent crime is largely gang-related but even then still quite rare   - Lots of fun things to do, many of which don't require a huge budget. For example, you can swim in the harbor baths year-round and simply sit outside with a book when the weather is good. Nightlife is pretty decent for pubs, bars, and restaurants; I'm not a huge fan of clubs in general, so I can't comment too much on that.   - The council actively tries to improve locals' quality of life, which is a huge contrast to where I am from (London)   - Friendly locals and a big international community. It can be hard to make friends, but I would say that you'll be okay if you join clubs/actively pursue your own interests. Instagram and MeetUp are both great options for finding people with similar hobbies :)   - A good mix of architecture. You've got pretty old houses and more interesting modern designs, some are hideous (i.e. Kaktus Towers) but most blend in quite well IMO   - The airport is very good, close to the city center, and has lots of flights across Europe and other continents   - Close to both mainland Europe and the rest of Scandinavia. You can get to Hamburg in 4.5 hours by train, for example, and Sweden is not far away   - Summer in Copenhagen is amazing. Long daylight hours, reliable weather for the most part, feels like you're on a two-and-a-half month long holiday.   - Lots of coworking spaces. I usually work from Spaces, Regus has various offices as well but these are hit and miss. The best ones are Havnegade and Fuglevangsvej in my opinion  Cons:   - Winters aren't great. It's windy, it rains a lot, and the daylight hours are short. However, that's a great excuse to visit the many cafés and restaurants, because hygge and stuff :)   - The cost of living is much higher than most European cities. If you're moving here as a remote worker and staying long-term, I would personally say that you should ensure that your income is at least $5,500 per month. Taxes are also high  - The housing market is a bit of a mess. Rent prices are high and it can be difficult to find an apartment if you're on a budget. Movinn and LifeX are two choices you can look at as starting points   - Moving to Denmark if you're not an EU/EEA/Nordic/Swiss citizen is very difficult. I have an EU citizenship through one of my parents so this didn't affect me, but you'll have to deal with a lot of paperwork if you aren't one. If you're from EU/EEA/Nordics/Switzerland, it's pretty easy if you have the means to support yourself   - The city center can be quite crowded on weekends, especially around Nyhavn etc.—but if you leave the touristy parts, you'll be fine. Copenhagen has plenty of other interesting neighborhoods anyway :)   Overall, I would say that Copenhagen is easily one of the most liveable cities in Europe—if not top of the list. The cost of living is high and it can be difficult to move here, but once you've settled, life is pretty good in my opinion. You can get around with English, but learning Danish opens new opportunities and a lot of stuff is done in Danish rather than English. If you're able to move here, and you can stand the winter weather, I highly recommend it :) ",

A bus driver also refused to let me pay and take the bus, so I have to get off. I really don't see this famed Turkish hospitality they gush about here. People are unfriendly or standoffish. I feel either invisible or a walking atm or whore to people. Not human.    I was also followed by some creep. Mind you a lot of this happened in a supposedly \"liberal\" and \"open minded\" part of Istanbul. The food is medicore and bland, and they charge like 20 dollars. It's honestly feels more expensive than Greece and just as expensive as Vienna. Airbnb prices are also out of control. Over 1000-2000 usd and they don't even have a stove for you to cook in a tiny, dingy studio. ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "I spent 4 months working here during summertime. It's one of the best summers I have ever had in my life. The city is just amazing and offers dozens of outdoor activities. There are so many different places such as parks, lakes, hills, mountains, beaches, etc. Also, you can feel the Californication vibe on every step.  I lived in Hollywood and I would avoid this place at any cost. It's just too overrated and won't meet your expectations. Hollywood (esp. West Hollywood) is a big pile of dirtiness with people wandering around. I'd suggest looking for smaller neighborhoods preferably in The Valley. That area is just lovely. Also, anything close to Santa Monica is overwhelming yet too costly.  One of the things I also didn't like was the lack of cultural influence and this is for sure not a city that will offer nice architecture. Another thing I disliked was the huge social distancing towards foreigners which is most likely part of the American culture. If you were to make deeper friendships here, this is not a place to go. You will end up getting ignored and in the worst case, people will stop any contact with you.  Also, the public transport of LA is not reliable especially if you use bus transportation. Get ready to wait a long turn before you get to a bus. I suggest either using the metro or renting a car which is probably the best option in LA. Otherwise, get prepared for long walks throughout your place of stay.  With all of the above said, I will for sure return to this city again and can't say I'm not missing it. It's one of those places where you always want to get back, at least temporarily :D",

The 'pandemic' changed many things -- the cost of course, but also the culture -- the freedom and liberty have been contained. The police presence and size of the state have grown -- definitely doesn't feel so relaxed anymore. It's also important to note here -- there is limited ambition. Most are looking for an easy, fun and peaceful life -- which is great, but if you are building something or running a business it can feel like the culture doesn't support you in the ways you may want or need. I ultimately decided to pull back from this city for all these reasons -- but still enjoy visiting in small doses. ",

The downs : cost of living and fluctuating weather but at least you see the sun once in a while !",

Clearwater Beach was rated #1 beach in the US multiple years in a row by TripAdvisor, and for good reason. The sunsets are spectacular, water warm as bath water the majority of the year, and sand so soft and fine it’s like corn starch. Great sports town if you like sports, with pro teams in the NHL. MLB, and NFL that consistently perform well. Skyline is beautiful and there are many great restaurants. Temperatures are comfortable year-round, and Tampa Bay is the “sweet spot” in Florida for avoiding hurricanes because of the jet stream and avoiding heat discomfort in the summer because of the wonderful cross-breezes that blow the humidity away. I highly recommend the Tampa Bay Area if you can afford it!",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Jeju seems gorgeous and cool (very breezy) in the spring, but the nicer the weather, it starts to get overrun with Chinese tourists. The trails along the coast have incredible views of cool islands in the ocean, with crashing waves against rocky cliffs, rolling meadows covered with flowers, and winding tree covered paths, though the trail has so many tourists that it’s very “manicured.”  Ask around or just explore and you can find more rustic mountain trails, pass by unexpected mound graves that will make you feel like Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, or climb up wooded trails leading to a surprise temple at the top of a mountain with incredible views of the sunset under the temple eaves. A lot of these places are away from the coast at higher elevations (and much cooler temps), away from where most of the tourists flock.  Compared to before, many more Western tourists have shown up, a lot from Western & Northern Europe, as well as from the Middle East and South Asia. Not too many Americans. English not widely spoken by the Koreans here, but depending on your luck, many Koreans try very hard to help. Education rate is extremely high, so many just pull out the Korean version of Google Translate (ChatGPT is much better with Korean than Google Translate), which then makes everything possible. You’ll run into the occasional grumpy old man, though. Incredibly safe at all hours for both men and women.   Something I just found out - 119 (Korean 911) is a public service, so if you have a medical emergency, call it, and it’s COMPLETELY FREE, even for non-Koreans with no insurance. But you’ll have to pay for medical services at the hospital if you don’t have traveler’s insurance. Med clinics and hospitals range anywhere in quality from the equivalent of French public clinics to posh Manhattan medical offices. I had an urgent ear problem, lost hearing in my right ear. It turned out to be ear wax I pushed into my ear with a Q-tip, lol. A very kind local pulled out her phone, looked on Korean Google (Naver), found me a highly rated ENT center just 10 minutes away. Gorgeous place, took me right in, and with no insurance I paid $15. I’d never be able to get an ENT appt in the US for weeks, instead would have waited hours at an urgicare center, and would have paid $50-$100 with insurance copayments. AMAZING.  My dog swallowed a small bone, a store clerk recommended a vet across the avenue - small but nice and clean facility. With ChatGPT, they did an exam, took X-rays, and gave him medicine, all for $13.  Some things here are expensive, but some things, even extremely nice or vital, like some medical services or 119, are incredibly cheap.   An EXCELLENT resource is the Jeju Integrated Call Center a nice man just told me about this morning to confirm potential ambulance costs (after my ear problem, I wanted to be prepared for bigger medical emergencies in a foreign country). On a local cell phone, dial 064-120. They have interpreters, and they are a Jeju tourism Association organization for non-Jeju people (Koreans and foreigners) to help us navigate the Jeju system. They will answer questions from where to go for medical services, to tourist attractions, to how to get around the island. They will also connect you to organizations you may be trying to find to get more detailed information. They helped me figure out how to find where I could easily fly to quickly restart the clock on my 90-day time-limited tourist visa.  Remember that while Jeju is a “subtropical’ island in Asia, it is not Thailand. With only 50 million people, it is the world’s 12th largest economy and one of the most high-tech countries in the world. It doesn’t make sense to expect prices like in Vietnam or the Philippines, and Koreans expect themselves to speak English about as much as Americans expect themselves to speak Spanish, even though there are exponentially more Spanish speakers in the US than English speakers in Korea.   We are digital nomads, meaning we are supposed have a non-American-centric perspective after traveling to so many places. Travel to Japan to find even fewer people speaking English, and even more annoyance that we expect them to, behind their apologetic facade.  If you are looking for a cheap place for a temporary workplace, Jeju might not be your best choice, but would you expect anything different from Japan or Barcelona?  But compared to Seoul, accommodations are cheaper, and it’s a beautiful place to stay at the right season.    I hope this review helps. Jeju isn’t for everyone, but for some, it’s a real gem, and with the few things that I was lucky to find out, I hope these can make the challenges of being somewhere very different smoother so you can focus on the beauty here!  Cheers!",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Where cowboys and the wild west truly started, San Antonio is a beautiful and historic city with many layers to explore within and outside the city. It's a hotter town than Austin, not just in temperature, but also in terms of friendliness, activities, family values, and cultural richness (with authentic tacos of all types, Tex-Mex, Cali style, and from Mexico City), it has one of the best culinary and cocktail scenes in the country. It's one of the most affordable for millennials in the States with rich multicultural diversity, being predominantly Hispanic and inclusive. Many are bilingual in Spanish, but English is predominant as anywhere else in the States. From aviation (first military flight) to tech (the invention of the microprocessor), and even Hollywood (the first Best Picture), San Antonio has been home to many firsts. The spirit of these firsts has continued through the ages. Nowadays, there are incredibly fast internet speeds thanks to Google Fiber in many parts of town, San Antonio has all the ingredients for a booming creative economy due to a convergence of incentives in film, gaming, and traditional arts. Downtown San Antonio has old Spanish-architecture, mixed with colorful murals by local artists, and southern Texan charm, but it's the beautiful people who really make the town flourish. ",

Senggigi is just one of its many long white sand beaches and a lot of them are still waiting to be discovered. Not much of a party going on here, but if you are itching for one, just hope to a speed boat for 15 minutes and you will arrive in the wild gili trawangan.

    "descriptionFromReview": "Lived in Phuket for a year now. Amazing place, especially the Bang Tao area. The further you go up north, the more beautiful it gets. Amazing beaches, beach clubs, restaurants and people. Patong is nice for a few days, but if you're not into partying just stay away. A lot of police check on the roads around Patong (and accidents), so always bring your international license.   You can make it as expensive (or cheap) as you want, if you eat local like I do a meal is around 60 - 120 baht. Stay away from hostels and meet like minded people in the gym, more luxurious beach clubs and events. Stay away from hostels and cheap guests only coming to party and use drugs. Use common sense.   Great place for active people, lots of good gyms, muay thai camps and other ways to work on your health. ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Driving looks and feels dangerous. It isn't. It's just scary to start (and I've got over a million miles in a truck across North America). That's probably why the 'dangerous' reviews. Was surprised to find EVERY time something happened, like a car door randomly opening in front of you or sudden lane disappearance, the drivers in the lane you needed made space. Drivers have exceptional road awareness. It's just that it's scary doing 75 km/h in a bumper to bumper traffic jam. Being a pedestrian is scary as cars have right of way. This is pretty normal around the world so not exceptional. Food is excellent. But not cheap. Service IS good if you're not a RICHARD. People unbelievably helpful and accommodating to foreigners. Huge, clean beaches along the ENTIRE ocean. You can drive an hour from the city, nothing around, no beach flotsam, sargasm or trash. It HAS to have been groomed as not even dead fish. But why? Nobody around. Amazed us. Bums look scary. Looks like you'll need shots if you come into contact. They just go away if you're firm. Wouldn't walk the ports at night. But you're an idiot if you do that ANYWHERE. LOVED THE PLACE. Would really like to move here. Only it's expensive. I'll keep looking but for us... to of our list to stay. ",

I love the character of the different neighborhoods, the variety of architectural styles, and as others have said, the food scene is incredible.  It's easy to make friends in the suburbs, perhaps not so much in the city itself.  I have never witnessed racial tension here, and have been pleasantly surprised by the interracial friendliness I have observed.  There are a wonderful selection of forests and parks just about everywhere, and the museums can't be beat.  There's always something to do - too many choices!  In recent years, though, the crime rate has increased significantly.  Shootings are becoming increasingly commonplace - including people firing guns out of cars on the expressways.  In spite of that, Chicago definitely has a personality all its own, and I will always love it.  ",

Because it's a student town there's also a lot to do here, even for non-students. By West-European standards the prices are reasonable. Pretty much everyone speaks English fairly well, and Dutch is not too hard to pick up on. The location of Leiden in the Netherlands is also neat: 10 min by train to The Hague, 20-ish to Schiphol Airport, 30 min to Rotterdam, 40-ish min to Amsterdam and Utrecht. The biggest drawback I can think of is the fact that the housing market is very oversaturated because of the number of students who live here, so it might be tough to find a place to stay. ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "New York is cool. I’ve visited multiple times to see my family throughout my life, and recently came back from my first post-COVID trip there. Yes, it’s very expensive — but there is no city on earth that’s more captivating in my opinion. I used to think that New Yorkers were smug by claiming that NYC was better than everywhere else, but now I totally get it lol.   My personal favourite neighbourhood is the Upper East Side, which is where you’ll find the coveted Museum Mile. But I also like Harlem and Brooklyn. Truthfully, the best thing you can do is just wander around with stops in local eateries along the way.   As another reviewer mentioned, there’s a lot of main character energy in NYC. Personally, I love that — and I always feel energised when I’m here. It makes me want to go out and achieve my biggest dreams, and the New York skyline is captivating.   In terms of safety, I actually found NYC safer when visiting than I have prior to COVID. I may have just been lucky, and I was only there for a week, but that’s my opinion/experience. YMMV, of course. Some subway stations made me feel on edge, but my experience was fine for the most part. (I still think the subway needs a huge revamp, though, as it’s definitely looking quite tired 😄).   I would love to come back here and live for 3-12 months. Anything more than that would probably be too much for me personally, but at least visiting is something that you must do at least once. And even if you come here 20+ times, there’ll always be something interesting that you haven’t seen/experienced before. ",

The people, culture and experience of Ko Samui is wonderful.  The roads are dangerous usually due to tourists. Not the locals LOL! This will be changing with Thai law requiring drivers license's. Of course it is humid and sweaty, my goodness you are in the tropics, and April is the hottest month. I suggest researching the best times of year to visit the islands, and Thailand in general. Most people go from A/C to A/C venues anyhow. The beaches and ocean are magical, the tours to the islands are so inexpensive and you have unique experiences diving, swimming, and meeting new people.  In the tourist areas people will speak more English, but then again, you are in their country, there are many apps to help translate. Don't let these CONS deter you from the incredible people and beauty of Ko Samui.. it's our favorite place in Thailand. ",

It's an imposing place and not the most welcoming, but that's because it takes time to adjust. In a nutshell: beautiful parks, very modern infrastructure , friendly people, good transportation (the subway is FAR superior to London or NYC, for example), amazing food, relatively cheap, extremely safe, loads to do, incredible history. The one major con is the air pollution—it can get really bad, so beware. Throughout my time in Beijing, I was constantly discovering new places and meeting interesting people. When I was there, there were plenty of foreigners and people were mostly very welcoming towards us. It's a special place. There are also loads of cafes and bars where you can work from, with good internet. A must-visit is the Friends Cafe—it's modelled after Central Perk from the sitcom Friends. They have good internet, delicious coffee and snacks, and Friends is playing on the TV 24/7! Disclaimer: Not sure if it's still in operation now.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Lived here for 6 months 2X over the last few years. This city is so under the radar. While medellin is overrun with gringos you will find very few here. International food is quite good and you will even find michelen starred restos here. Internet is great, and many cafes or coworking/weworks to work out of. Bogota is a tech capital in latam, so a decent place to farm out work, although dont expect mass english proficiency.  Women here are very good looking but more of the \"classy\" type versus the reggaeton video types you see in medellin. If you can find a solid gf/wife you will never leave trust me colombian women are one of a kind.  Traffic is some of the worst so make sure you can walk everywhere you gotta go or alternatively only travel outside of rush hour. Has all your favorite apps like uber and rappi as well. Rappi was actually invented here. Where you stay really matters as the class divide in Bogota is huge. Personally lived in Chico which I loved. Other people say rosales is good and if you like suburban life usaquen. South of the city is a no go, and probably a warzone. Night life is decent and has all types from classy to grungy. Chapinero and 85 are good for parties. Careful in chapinero at night, dont drink too much. Safety can be a problem mainly at night but if you live in chico,rosales, usaquen you dont really need to worry so much. Also Bogota is one of the most creative cities not just latam but worldwide. A true haven for artists of all types, big graffiti culture, and a ton of cool museums. Place is generally cheap if you earn dollars, but if you wanna spend big there are places. Also good for people on a budget as well. Weather wise it rains a lot and almost has a permanent \"fall feeling\". If you love fall its the place for you. Pollution can be bad so avoid high traffic areas in rush hour, but rain clears away pollution. For me personally Bogota is a true hidden gem, and an awesome place.",

The excitement and chaos are novel for a short time, particularly in the old medina. Scams, expensive and tiresome. For sure Marrakech is something to experience, it really is a buzz, especially if you want to shop but within a couple of days I learned to avoid the medina as much as I could and within a week I was ready to leave. Plenty of excursions and day trips including Atlas mountains, Sahara, Essaouira and surrounding towns/villages to get you out of Marrakech but living staying a long time is too much.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "I recently visited Amsterdam for the third time (and the first time since 2018). I personally think it's a little overrated, but a cool place to visit nonetheless.   The architecture is beautiful, and there are lots of good places to eat. I don't like the main area of the canals in the city centre; it smells of weed and is often packed. However, the outer edges - such as the Jordaan district - are less busy and more interesting in my opinion.   One thing that surprised me is how much trash was on the streets. Many bins were full, and there was waste - such as abandoned mattresses - in a lot of areas. Some people have said this is because of the bottle deposit initiative and people looking through the trash, but I live in Copenhagen and we have this... yet the city is much cleaner IMO.   If you visit, try to come on a weekday. Also, the streets near the canals can be quite chaotic with bikes, cars, and scooters. Again, I'm used to bikes as I live in Copenhagen and cycle myself - but it's much more organised than in Amsterdam IMO.   Pros:  - Beautiful architecture  - The people are nice  - Efficient public transport  - Good food and nightlife   Cons:  - Very dirty  - Crowded in the central parts  - Can feel quite chaotic   I would recommend visiting Amsterdam, but I don't know if I would personally live there. The Netherlands has plenty of places that are just as beautiful and interesting, such as Utrecht, Leiden, and Haarlem. I would also recommend visiting The Hague and Rotterdam, even though both cities are perhaps not as pleasing on the eye. TL;DR: Nice place to visit, but I would not live here.",

Be ready to spend more than 30 euros per person per meal to eat anything remotely decent - The locals will try to scam you any time they can - The night life is very poor, I am not sure why the score is so high - Traveling here with gf/spouse: Egypt is not the most welcoming place for western women  I would say it is good for stays of less than 1 month, but after 1 month you will want to leave.

The climate is just about always perfct (if you don't mind clouds from now and then). You are close to nature and I would say it is one of the most spectacular islands in the world (I traveled to about 140 countrys worldwide). You will be surprised to see how much the island can offer. I still find new trails and places to discover.  However! Sadly the island is changing. First of all, accomidation is getting very expensive and this has changed very quickly. Expect the same price as northern Europe but with much lower living standard. The appartmens here is not build with quality. Also, latley there has been demonstrations towards forginers and digital nomands in particular. I do understand the locals as it is getting to expenstive on the island (even for me as a Scandinavian). I would also like to add that food is a problem here. You will find it hard to find quality and that means both resturantes and supermarkets. An island in a nutshell I suppose.",

Around greenbelt you have three decent sized parks available. Outside of this small bubble of cosiness its chaos dirt and sketchiness. Stay away from Poblacion, its just disgusting. Best bet for a clean and comfortable place to stay are hotels and serviced apartments. Avoid airbnb, its all trash. BGC is another alternative, tough I don't like it much there, its too crowded and too much traffic for me. ",

I live here 8.5 years and I experienced the above multiple times. Police seems only cares about crime against person by whatever reason. Insure everything expensive that you own. I would also add that antisocial behaviour is quite common here and teenagers are heavily involved in crimes as police don't do anything with them because of their age. Basically there were months that my area was patrolled by gangs on bikes trying to snatch the phone (luckily they are less noticeable in the last period). The video of cutting the bike chain in front of the shopping centre in day light got viral and even the criminal was without a mask. I could continue a list of very worrying crime that is happening in quite nice and popular by family with kids area of zone 2. Yes, except your psychological condition you will likely be safe based on my experience.",

Madeira in one of the safest places in Europe, is extremely clean and well kept. Infrastructure is great (best internet, great roads and a huge network of tunnels that enable people to travel easily around the island). Climate is simply amazing (I swam in the ocean at Christmas time, water was 21 degrees). Great for walking in nature, diving, canyoning, active people will never get bored. Cost of living is very affordable, although I agree rents are going up and real estate prices definitely on the up too due to an increased interest from Europeans and North Americans. Food is all local and fresh, including great fish and seafood. Restaurants are plentiful and affordable. Even top restaurants like Akua will only set you back around 50 euros a head for a top meal including wine. There is a large and friendly international community that organisers many events for all tastes. Some of the people below seem really disgruntled. I think Madeira is an awesome place to spend time in. ",

Construction is rampant everywhere, it’s just build, build, build and it’s only going to get more intense. The new highway has opened up, which makes the trip from Oaxaca only 3 hours. Local Mexicans come for long weekends since the drive is now tolerable, which is packing the town.   It feels like the majority of foreigners I meet either want to start a business or own real estate here. I never made it to Bali, but from the conversations I’ve had for other DN, this is like Bali right before post-pandemic. It’s strange - everyone you chat with knows this area is heading for Tulum, yet too many people just have dollar signs in their eyes - or in this case Mexican Pesos.  This is no longer a sleepy surf town. Come see it soon before it gets nuts. The clock is ticking.",

Poor quality in everything, even the luxury experiences are a total rip-off. Surprisingly underdeveloped too, not even a bar on their observation deck in Bitexco. Internet is really good, but stay as far from D1 as you can - somehow it's filthier than everywhere else & seems like they're trying to turn this area into a red light district, so it's very noisy with a lot of obvious prostitution happening. No matter what you ask for in a cafe or restaurant, you'll get what they feel like serving lol Grab drivers are not helpful or friendly at all, all of them seemed bothered by having to deal with you, but there's no other way to get around. Being here for 2 months cured me of ever wanting to visit SEA ever again, so there's that. ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Being born there, it's hard to be objective, as most exciting stuff looks dull and tired. But walking in the old town and looking at the castle always makes me feel proud. The city is very cheap considering the living standard (and comparing to other similar Canadian cities). Internet speed are incredibly high and stable even in cheap coffee shops. The coworking scene, either in coffee shops or dedicated workplaces is very interesting. In winter, it gets WAY too cold, but the coldest period lasts from November to March so it's not that bad. Definitely worth a try.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Kathmandu has frequent power outages as of December 2019 even though everyone says otherwise, as does Pokhara.  The old outages are referring to the load shedding issue which were routine power outages for the majority of the day.  Now power outages are not routine and can last unknown amounts of time, even the main (and only) airport loses power often.  Buildings are unheated, water for showering is generally unheated or lukewarm, many houses get their water from urban aquifers which may be heavily polluted, as city water is yellow and oily.  Many roads in the city are dirt, and air quality is extremely poor, especially during the crop burning season.  Locals are friendly and helpful and many outside of tourist areas may have never met a foreigner before.  The locals and the mountains make the place special, everything else about it is quite bad, notably hygiene, food safety, traffic danger, and exposure to all sorts of environmental pollutants.  That said, I will be returning to visit the local friends made while there.",

I thought it would be great to live here, start a startup and be in the same time zone as SF, close to Seattle, etc. But compared to Vancouver in 2009, one big change that totally ruined it for me: Absolute zombie apocalypse of drug addicts and shouting/violent home less people. It was shockingly bad. The locals often visibly carry naxalone (anti-overdose medicine, I learned) because there are so many people overdosing in the street. Police were nowhere to be seen. Such a shame, I would have loved to live in this beautiful city otherwise. ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Panama City very interesting and slept on. Probably the most developed major city in Latin America with the strongest technology infrastructure which makes it very appealing for digital nomads. Also a lot of international business coming through here so there can definitely be good networking opportunities.  It’s also super safe compared to other South American hotspots like Medellin however it is significantly more expensive. I would say prices here are slightly less expensive than southern small-towns in the rural United States  The crowd does feel a bit more touristy than I would personally like but there are interesting people that you will meet here who are primarily from Europe.  The local seafood is good and there are a lot of great international options all over town.  Nightlife is strong on the weekends and if you’re specifically looking for that, I would recommend staying at the Selina in Casco Viejo since they have a rooftop sky bar and an underground club which are the most popular spots in town and are tough to enter if you’re not a Selina guest.  I do agree with the last comment that this city does seem like it can get boring fast if you’re staying for an extended vacation but if you’re spending most of your days living a normal daily life of work, self-care, exercise, basic social life, this is not a bad place to do it.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Brasilia is a hidden gem in the middle of Brazil. Very safe city, with good restaurants, super safe traffic, very green, perfect for biking, and with a high level of education.  Shaped like an airplane, it is the most famous planned town in the world, by legendary architect Oscar Niemayer. Internet is good, you can rent a cheap Airbnb, most of them with a green view, There are more than 800 waterfalls close by (check Chapada dos Veadeiros) and hiking spots.  The climate very pleasant as long as you don't go in August/September which is too dry and hot.  It's also a cafe paradise, with very good baristas. Its the perfect place to chill if you have to focus on a project while living abroad. It's not big on clubs and nightlife but meet some locals and you will find the best parties at home or crazy places in your life.  Rent a car for your stay to have a better experience - or get yourself a bike, cuz it has bike lanes everywhere - and bikes for renting on an app if you wish to.  There's a lake with many activities around it, from bars to bike lanes to Hawaiian canoeing, windsurfing, etc. There are many boat rentals around it. There are many recreational parks in town too- check Parque Olhos D'agua.  Never ever miss the sunset, the sky is amazing!!! 360 degrees of color explosion. Look up at the trees and you will see tucans and macaws flying among many other types of birds. There are many interesting bars, you just have to do your research.  There are many malls with stores that go from Louis Vuitton to the local store, so you will find anything. All the embassies are in Brasilia, so you will find many expats living here.  This review is referring to Brasilia only, not the cities around it - which are a bit less safe, so if you go stay at Asa Sul or Asa Norte. Lago Sul and Lago Norte are safe too but there's not much going on there. ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Bali for grownups. It's perfectly safe. I could walk in 95% areas of Floripa at night with my phone taken out without any feeling of danger. Safer than Rio, for sure. All types of water sport and hikes are available here, so it's a good place for people who are into nature. Place isn't very trendy and service sometimes isn't that good but it's getting there. As anywhere in Brazil, people here don't in general speak English. But they're so friendly that they will always try to help you out and smile. Outside of Centro you usually need a car, even though it's walkable as there are sidewalks, but distances are quite big for walking. Uber works everywhere so that wasn't an issue for me either. There is also a working food delivery. Weather can be really nice in low season of June-August, in case you don't like when it's too hot.  In short, it's a great place to get familiar with Brazil if you're worried about safety.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "I spent a month in Tirana in February 2022 and then returned in October for a one-week stay. Generally, I was pleasantly surprised and would recommend Tirana. Here are my Pros and Cons:  Pros: - Cheap: Airbnbs are cheap (especially on a monthly basis), food is very cheap (around a third of what you would pay in Germany) and still good quality (most of the time). - Walkable: The city center is pretty compact and everything can be reached on foot - Green: The city center has multiple parks around the main boulevard. The big city park has an artificial lake and paths for runners and cyclists. - Nice People: All locals that I talked to were very nice. I once went to the barber who was the nicest dude ever. We talked for around 1.5 hours about Albania, politics, economics and so on. That way, I learned a lot about the country. - Great coworking cafes: I can recommend the Destil Creative Hub and the Coolab. Nice people, good coffee and a good internet connection. Stay away from the #TECHSPACE, though. Very bad internet, tedious to even get in, not a good experience there. - Safe: I never felt unsafe, even when walking back to my Airbnb at night. There also were a lot of women walking around at night. Also, locals told me that pickpocketing is not a problem in Tirana since there are only few tourists. - Night Life: There are many bars around the city center. Even during the week, there are many people out partying.  Cons: - Boring: There is not much to do generally. There are a few museums like the National History Museum, the two Bunk'art museums (old bunkers from communist times) and the House of Leaves. All of them are focused on Albanian History. I can especially recommend Bunk'art 1. It's impressive to wander through this huge bunker. The National History Museum starts strong with a really cool exhibition of relicts and statues from Ancient times on the ground floor. On the top floors, most texts are not translated into English. Also, the exhibitions are partially very old school or trashy (the exhibition about Mother Teresa looks like it was designed by a child in Word 2003). - No digital nomad community: I would have loved to meet more digital nomads, but sadly there is no real community there (yet). - Cars: Traffic is insane in the city. And people drive like crazy. Take care when walking over the road (even at crosswalks). I was almost hit by a car on the crosswalk twice. Also, I was surprised that I made it from the airport to the city and back without an accident, considering the driving style of most drivers. - Coldness: Since it's pretty hot in Albania for most of the year, most buildings don't have heating or well-isolated walls (apartments as well as restaurants, museums etc.). I was there in February and I was constantly cold. So I would recommend visiting Tirana in spring or autumn when it's neither cold nor super hot. In October, the temperature was nice. - Public Toilets: Toilets in public places and restaurants are mostly filthy and unhygienic. Most places don't have urinals, still most men appear to urinate standing up and have terrible aim. That leads to piss being all over the toilet and on the floor. It was like this almost everywhere I went.  Generally, I enjoyed my time in Tirana and I definitely plan to visit a third time. I can recommend it to everyone, but especially to people who are on a budget.  In spring, you can get a nice Airbnb in the city center for around 500€ - 700€ a month, WizzAir offers cheap flights to Tirana from many major European cities (100€ - 150€ there and back) and food is pretty cheap (main course + drink around 10€ at most restaurants). So I estimate you can visit Tirana for a month at around 1000€ - 1400€ in spring.",

As someone else said there are the commie block vibes, but those are in more peripheral neighborhoods. I felt it was safe, and had no issues getting around by tram mostly. As someone mentioned there is definitely the traditional Southern European cafes are for socializing, not working kind of vibe but still a decent number had wifi and didn't bat an eye at working all day. Winter gets too cold (single digits C), but early fall was lovely.",

I've been working in Maakri area, which is local City. Really loved my time here, especially variety of quality food options available. My favourite upscale place to eat was FARM restaurant, which is a gem of a resto located in the beginning of Tallinn's Old Town.

    "descriptionFromReview": "Husband and I spent one month here, and we didn’t like it, at all!  There is a lot of litter and graffiti everywhere!!!!  The entire city needs a good power wash.  I think that due to the volume of transitant people who live here, not much effort is put in to make it nicer.  It’s a shame because there are some really nice buildings and neighborhoods that would be lovely if there was some care put into them.  Unfortunately, it’s all dirty and run down.  Almost every night, you will hear fireworks go off at all hours, especially if you are near any of the parks.  It’s maddening!  I’m aware that Manchester is the “working class/historically industrial” city of the UK, just sad that not a lot of effort has been put into it.  We didn’t feel comfortable being out at night as there were several dodgy people out loitering the bus stops and yelling at random people.  I will state though that they are doing some renovations and new construction in some areas, so perhaps in about 10 years it might get better, especially if more Londoners move up here.  Also, there are nice neighborhoods such as Didsbury to stroll around.  Overall, very disappointed and have no plans on returning.  ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Stayed in PP for around 2 months. I would say it appeals to a certain type of person. Unlike capital cities in neighboring countries, I found the vibe to be more relaxed. The city basically shuts down at 9pm. I would say if you want to visit, you should be willing to invest more in accomodations. I tried keeping my budget similar to those in Bangkok and that was my biggest mistake of my stay here. The Airbnbs I booked for around $20-25 a night had very slow wifi, no hot water or no water at all in some cases. If I had raised my budget I think I would have had a more enjoyable experience overall. ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Melbourne is a fun and cute compact city. There are so many fun things to do here such as visit is beaches, go to its theme parks out of the CBD area. Its city CBD is so much fun as well. You can visit the Queen Victoria market which is the largest outdoors market in the world! You can also visit Federation Square which is a beautiful park on the edge of the CBD, and you can visit the Eureka Skydeck and Australia 108 which are the tallest buildings in Australia if you exclude the antenna from the Gold Coast's Q1 tower. If you are into surfing, there are surf beaches about a 1-2 hour drive out of the Melbourne area at the nearest. Melbourne is a really good city to reside in if you like fun, but of course it does come with a cost. Melbourne is the 6th most expensive city in the world according to recent reports. Overall, an awesome city",

I recommend: Miradouro da Ponta da Madrugada - many cows grazing everywhere - many cats  - not many people - very chill, feels like a perfect place for retirement  Bad: - no uber/bold. need to order taxi by locally local companies who do not speak neglish. tip: hotel can help - pedestrian roads missing, you will end up walking on a road - not many cafes/mini markets ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Pros: Safe, beautiful views, loads of nice little beach towns a taxi ride away. Native cuisine is delicious, maybe the best value restaurants in Europe.  8 months of pleasant weather. Old town is pretty charming. Local fruits are excellent and inexpensive. 1 Euro taxi rides. Georgians are generally warm. English ability among youth is good for FSU.  A decent hipster coffee/bar/cafe/coworking scene is emerging from the Ru/Bel/Ukr exile community. The boardwalk on the coast is long and excellent - perfect for running and cycling. Kutaisi airport is only a 24 euro taxi ride away, so lots of cheap connections to central Europe and FSU.  Cons: Roads are total chaos, being a pedestrian is scary. International food options and supermarkets are limited.  New apartment towers are poorly built, extremely noisy and waiting for the elevator can waste 30 minutes of your day.  Businesses seem poorly managed, this results in queues and mistakes.  For a nomad who wants to live somewhere for 6 months, on a low cost of living, focus on work and maintain an active lifestyle. Batumi is one of the best options in 2023.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Totally agree with all the other reviews. Nothing good, nothing terrible, but no reason to come here unless you are super into Serbian culture & plan to stay long-term. \r I'm staying in Pancevo, a little town right outside Belgrade, just a 20 minute bus ride (without traffic, which is LA-levels of terrible). The town itself is much more beautiful & charming than Belgrade, I have to say. Belgrade is really ugly, & it's true that there's neither Soviet nor classically European architecture - just bland, brown, square & rectangular buildings with some ugly newer glass box ones thrown in. Also found that getting around Belgrade is mega unpleasant - lots of traffic, shockingly few cafes, which is crazy since that's always one of the things people rave about here. So basically you either have to spend a lot of time figuring out their dysfunctional public transport, paying for expensive, unreliable taxis, or walking the uninteresting streets dodging aggressive locals with nothing nice to look at. \r Pros (very few): safe, clean, hot guys & mostly attractive women, easy to get a cheap SIM card. \r Aside from that, super unpleasant vibe - everyone is sour & borderline aggressive. People cut in front of you at the supermarket, just elbow you right out the way to get what they need. People on sidewalks almost try to race you in order to either overtake or keep pace, it's really odd. Have no idea why people keep saying the locals speak English, as almost no one in either Belgrade center or the town I'm in can manage more than a broken sentence, & that's IF they speak any English at all. Which leads me to the next untrue myth: the people are not warm or friendly at all. I have made good efforts to use their language, but each time there is visible anger that they're having to deal with a foreigner. Again, I found this in the center of Belgrade & in the town I'm staying in. Also agree with everyone that there's absolutely nothing to do outside of going to a café & drinking. There are parks everywhere, but how many times are you going to visit the same 10 parks? As an American, I already have the experience of living in a city you have to leave in order to have fun in nature, so I'm not impressed with the excursions outside the Belgrade area - it's stuff we already have at home, & frankly, our nature is way better & more impressive with more stuff to do, as there's nothing exotic enough here to justify the terrible living experience. \r Also find that the gym experience is crap, as the town I'm in doesn't have a lot & they're expensive with weird rules that won't make sense to you as a foreigner. Also shocked that this town doesn't have any street workout areas, as I thought Serbia & Slavic countries in general were kinda known for this culture (guess I was wrong lol). \r A final note, the town I'm in has a lot, and I mean A LOT, of packs of stray dogs roving around, it's kinda scary since you don't know what the rabies situation is here. Some are aggressive, but most are just sleeping lol\r Overall, I'm glad I came for a short stay to satisfy my curiosity, but I really want to leave & I would never recommend coming here for any reason. I've been to one other Slavic country, the Czech Republic, & I LOVED it, so if you have a Slavic curiosity, go there, but certainly don't waste time in Serbia. ",

Lithuanians indeed are a bit closed in, but that's only till the first drink, then everyone becomes besties. If you struggle with making friends visit \"Dzem Pub\" bar, it's very popular between foreigners and students, after a couple drinks people will come up to get to know you, don't be too shy to just ask groups if you can join them!",

There's amazing food (Asian, Western and fusion). You'll be surrounded by entrepreneurs, artists, fashion designers and models. Many of whom do speak English.\r \r It gets better if you speak basic Mandarin though. You don't need to care about the characters. Just learn to speak, that's important enough. The nice thing about Mandarin is China is so big everyone has an accent, so for Chinese it really doesn't matter so much that you have one too.\r \r Depending on how and what kind of money you make, your experience also changes. Like most places in Asia, English teachers are the lowest rank in the hierarchy of foreigners here. Chinese know. But if you're an entrepreneur, even (or especially) an online one, that's high regarded. The problem with working online here is obviously the firewall which can make it very difficult. I've heard good stories about Shadowsocks which seems to work better than regular VPNs.\r \r The recent China vs. America tensions are in fact making people slightly more hostile against Western foreigners. But remember this is Shanghai, it's a metropolitan city, they're usually much less xenophobic than out in the country. Mostly Shanghainese are happy to embrace foreigners, become friends with them, as long as they speak Chinese. And as long as you invest a lot of time. Just popping in and out like a nomad isn't necessarily going to work so well with Chinese. Relationships are long-term.",

They solved the problem of inspiring workspace with their facilities right in the center of town with an extraordinary sea view.  The great thing about Antalya as a destination is that you get it all: amenities of a big city (without the chaos of Istanbul), nature, culture, beaches, history, nightlife etc. Despite the heavy inflation, it's still reasonably affordable for those who earn In Euro or USD. The people are super friendly and easy going. And the nomad and expat community is rather interesting because there's a great diversity of nationalities that you don't get to meet in most famous DN-destinations. ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "I'm Polish and I've been to Gdańsk a number of times over the course of the last 10 years. When I was younger and have seen and experienced less, I was very impressed by the old town. However, these days, after having seen most of Europe and some of the US, I can't help but feel that Gdansk's old town is small and everything that surrounds it has a distinct, post-communist feel, which I do not enjoy. I was there this summer (2022) and it felt like being in an amusement park, with many of the apartment complexes around the old town turning into cheap, short stay aparthotels. The place felt empty due to that. The biggest allure of the city is that it is so close to the sea. Unfortunately, as locals would tell you, it is extremely crowded when the weather is nice, therefore most locals avoid the sea in the summer, which to me sounds weird. Considering the climate, I wouldn't want to be near that sea outside of the summer time!  To end this review on a more positive note, I think the city is well connected with the municipal rail making all parts accessible. It is very green outside of the old town and the air quality is the best among largest Polish cities. For foreigners, I think Gdańsk is a must see and as other commenters here noted, it's a good place to nomad from.",

It's definitely a gem, with not so many distractions and perfect to get the work done.  Coimbra has all the qualities of Portugal cities such as food, wine, safety, cultural events etc, everything quite low-cost oriented, specially accomodation -- you can find really good deals way cheaper than Lisbon or Porto. It's a bit tourist but not a trap. Great green spaces to relax, however it's a hill city and climbing up and down might be a con for those with reduced mobility.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "I stayed in Pokhara for a few months and it is a friendly place with a good music scene. there are plenty of amazing trekking opportunities around in the Himalayas. the people are very friendly and it's easy to make friends. Lots of travelers here are smoking weed, it seems to be pretty legal here. internet speeds are good (probably 15 up and down on average but I stayed in one place that was hitting 30) but power cuts are frequent in the summer (monsoon) months. Many hotels, guest houses, airbnbs are fitted with an inverter to combat this (which basically means one or two sockets and lights in the place will still work during a power cut, so make sure your place has an inverter and your modem is plugged into one of the working sockets. No co-working spaces available in Pokhara at this time. Overall I'd definitely recommend it but the inverter is a must! If you are doing research about Pokhara and you are worried about load shedding, rest assured it doesn't happen anymore (just be aware of the power outages in the monsoon months).",

I think it's better positioned than Tokyo to visit the highlights of the country. Has everything a digital nomad needs and more. I'm not much of partier but their is a scene with all music genres. People are very friendly but of course helps if you can speak Japanese. Don't have any cons. Would definitely recommend. ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Bengaluru, January  4-9, and 13-13, 2020.  Had a good time in Bengaluru ( formerly Bangalore). At first I stayed at the Parijatha Gateway Hotel, Near Soap Factory Metro, which was ideal for my purposes.  Transit & shopping was nearby, and there was a mall and good food.  The Metro in BLR is VERY modern and smooth- be prepared to be patted down (women and men separately) to get into the station, and you can but a metrocard at the ticket window.  In Bangalore the internet is VERY fast (it is India's Silicon Valley) and every other person is an engineer... and can chat you up in multiple languages.( their English may be better than yours :).  Uber works well inside the city, but I advise a pre-paid taxi from the airport to your hotel (as flagging down your Uber at the airport is a bit difficult because of the congestion there).  Now, lets talk about  traffic- I have lived in NYC and I can say with authority that, yes, Bangalore has the worst traffic congestion I have ever seen. Any time that Google maps gives you to get anywhere by Auto or bus in Bangalore can be Doubled or Tripled to get the actual time of transit- you can't make this sit up... I am not kidding. All that aside, I never felt unsafe in Bangalore.   Food in Bangalore is varied and tasty...  You will have a good variety of Vegetarian and non-vegetarian options available to you.  I did not seek out the night life, but there sure are some fancy upscale places if you want them.   My second stay ion the trip was at the Conrad Hilton, which is in a class all by itself but not your everyday Nomad kind of place (My expenses were being covered for that, the price per night is insanely low by western standards, and so if you need some amazing pampering for a night or two, this is your go-to place) .  Internet was fast, staff was attentive, scenery can't be beat. Uber back to the airport was easy.  I will return to Bengaluru in the future.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "From 2015 to 2019 I have lived in Chania. There were not many expats, mainly older brithisn expats. Some artists, writers etc... Organic shops just starting ,spiritual community just starting..  Few scattered ppl across the west of Crete. It has apparently started to change now, more and more expats coming, I see more and larger FB nomad groups.. back then there was absolutely nothing of such kind. I had tried to create community through couchsurfing back then and met a few interesting people. However I can confirm what was written before. There sems to be a nomad group and coworking now in Chania. Check in Facebook, I saw it.   Since 2019 the prices have risen and rent has not been affordable anymore. that's why I left in 2019. I was unable of find an apartment to rent all year. They tolerate you from Septebemr to May, then you have to leave.. where to? Even if you were ok to pay 700EUR plus amonth for an apartment, I couldn't find anyone interested in renting out year round. Mind you I do speak greek.  The greeks just make airbnb for 3 months in summer, then go to the olive picking...dancing in winter  then spring comes back. ITs a simple life for them and they don't think much ahead.  And they obviously dont need the extra income from housing. They all still own houses and land, so they dont need to worry about basic needs. Easiest is probably if you just buy a house  in a village. But that comes with structural problems.   Police, hospitals, public services,  workers, are not reliable.  Also if you have greek friends, they are nice as long as you give money, but you will never be part of the family and you can never rely fully on them. Just be warned. Good to have a mix  of friends. You ned the greeks to get the greek price and to get treated right otherwise you will be screwed over all the time.   If you are ok to bitt eh bullet, it can be enjoyable. Weather and the sea is great, and food is amazing. If you are very very patient then it might be your thing.  It really depends what you are looking for.  Internet was terrrible back then. Dont know about now... in 2022. I could not even desing my website with the home internet in the AIRBNB apartment. People there live very much offline, at the max they have a facebook company.. so dont expect things to be organised well.. ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Semiyak was my refuge from the crazy traffic, massive western crowds, mosquito attacks, and inflated prices of Canggu. Seminyak is not 'Balifornia' (Canguu), some will like it for that reason alone.   Traffic can get clogged in Seminyak but it's still far better than Canggu. Seminyak is just as commercialized as Canggu, but in a different way. If you're familiar with NY, Canggu has east village or lower east side vibes, while Seminyak is more soho.   Of course neither comes close to the actual NY neighborhoods. You could say Seminyak  is more polished with better infrastructure, so you'll find more sidewalks and high end artisan shops, while Canggu is like a super westernized village. Both areas are full of tourists, expats, and nomads, so you'll find plenty of good co working spaces, vegan cafes, and good coffee in Seminyak.  If you're trying to avoid mosquitos (and the gekkos they bring), there are definitely less in some parts of Seminyak, due to the infrastructure being more built up, although you still need to use repellent. Be alert to Seminyak scammers, they will spot you from a mile if you're western.  Thankfully my NY skills made it easy to avoid and/or get rid of them. Seminyak has some of the best beachfront bars and cafes, with pools overlooking the sea, better than what you find in Canggu. Don't get me wrong, I still love Canggu, just not thrilled with what it's become, and Seminyak provides an escape that's just a grab or scooter ride away.  If you decide to check out Seminyak you need to dig to find the gems. Because on the surface it's pretty typical, but once you discover some of the amazing places there, you can create your own hideaway. It took me a few days and many hours of research, by foot and online, to find the best hidden places of Seminyak. Prices are better than Canggu but again, you need to dig a bit.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "This city is a hidden gem in South America. The atmosphere is very laid-back, the locals are friendly and open to foreigners, and there is a lot of freedom (no stupid regulations or other rules). The infrastructure is definitely not as developed as in other countries, but it is developing very quickly. There are a lot of foreign investments because the country is probably the safest in South America, and the local government is small and right-wing. In the city itself, there is not much to do. There are some nice bars, padel courts, shopping centers, etc. The best thing you can do in the evening after work is to jump into the pool, drink a beer, and do asado (barbecue). It is a great place to chill. Living costs are lower compared to Europe or other countries in Latam.  Personally, I came here to set up a residency, and my plan was to stay a maximum of 2 weeks. I have been here for 4 months already, and I am sure there are many more to come. And I am not alone. There are many people in the same situation, some of them already moved to Paraguay. Consequently, there is a rapidly growing international community. Furthermore, if you are a businessman, you will love it - Paraguay is the land of opportunities. There are business opportunities wherever I look.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "I was here for almost three weeks last month. The internet is fast, and the surroundings are beautiful. The people are friendly, and most of them speak English well. I never felt unsafe during my stay. If you know where to go, there's plenty to do. There are many lovely parks, and the food is delicious and surprisingly affordable (I highly recommend Roxas). The shopping centers are of high quality. It's best to install the Grab app or take taxis for transportation. Public transportation can take a bit longer, but with Grab and taxis, you can get anywhere quickly, and it's reasonably priced. There's a relaxed atmosphere in Davao City. For beaches, it's best to visit Samal Island or spend a few days in Mati (approximately a three-hour drive). You won't encounter many Westerners or nomads here. Tourism is starting to pick up again after the pandemic, but most visitors are from Asia. I highly recommend it and will definitely come back here 100%.",

The skyline is beautiful at night. The food is good. The people are kind and always smiling... I prefer Jakarta to Bali ! And I've been multiple times in both. For sure it's a city with many skyscrapers, so the quality of the air is not great. But you can drive out of the city and have absolutely beautiful mountains and rice fields (such as Bogor). In the city center there are many malls with all the big brands you know of. So many delicious restaurants too. It is true that sometimes people dont speak English but... what's the point of travelling to Asia if you want absolutely everyone to speak the same language as you ? ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Liverpool is not a great place to live as a nomad. It is a perfect tourist / nightlife city; evident at the weekend where hordes of locals and partygoers from the surrounding areas descend on the city centre (bachelor and bachelorettes included). It has probably the best nightlife in the UK, due to the fact the city centre has perfect walkability and the local government has ensured there are ideal pockets of bars and clubs placed optimally around town.  A Londoner born and raised, I lived there for 5 years, leaving in June 2023 having become a nomad in February that year. Once becoming a nomad, all of the glaring issues arose which are important for a good nomad lifestyle which make it unsuitable to live in once adopting this lifestyle.  1. Nomadlist is accurate that it is very difficult to make friends here. There is a dominant university core of students who have a hostile attitude toward 'outsiders' (i.e. locals). This wouldnt be an issue in and of itself, but due to the city not having a sufficient young professional workforce (techy or otherwise) there arent many people in the city who you will have much in common with. Coupled with the fact that Scousers (Native Liverpool residents) are superficially friendly (they may be great to you on a night out, but they will never truly be your friend) it means the city has very jarring socio-demographics.  2. It is getting more expensive; with more and more Londoners realising the north is more cost effective, rent costs and general costs of everything has increased dramatically due to this. This is happening across the country in 2023-24, but due to the city actually declining somewhat, (ill get to that) there is no real justification for these cost increases (especially housing)  3. The weather is pretty terrible most of the year. In summer you may get a week of decent weather (and there is nowhere better to be than by the River Mersey on a hot day), but it can be very depressing, especially during winter.  4. The city government is not investing in city matters that will improve the city; they seem to only want to invest in matters relating to nightlife, and appeasing the local population who aren't particularly forward thinking. For example, there doesnt seem to be any new business's moving to the city, therefore any young professionals graduating from one of the five universities here, dont have any incentive to stay, live and invest in the city.   As of 2023, my negative points point to the fact that the city is now on another decline; it shouldnt be shortlisted as a nomad destination",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Plovdiv is as far as we can tell the nicest part of Bulgaria, but we can't see any reason why a person should choose to be in Plovdiv or Bulgaria when there are better options available for all aspects of life that we care about. Bulgaria is the poorest country in Europe, with very high rates of smoking - people can smoke inside restaurants with impunity here. Quality of life seems generally low. However, the food is delicious! :)  The expat community, even for a relatively large city such as Plovdiv, is a fraction the size of a relatively small city like e.g. Paphos, Cyprus. In Paphos there's all kinds of activities organised for any day of the week. In Plovdiv, even in peak season, it seems quiet, with little to do.  We didn't have high expectations for Bulgaria, but we were curious and wanted to explore. Bulgaria was below our expectations, and sadly we plan never to return. We can't think of any reason to recommend Bulgaria above one of the many better choices out there such as Prague, Krakow, Budapest, Paphos, most other European cities.",

But the food is amazing, cost of living is cheap, and the parks and mountains surrounding you make it worth visiting! You can literally hike a gorgeous mountain walking about 5 minutes south of the old city center. It's also the most central location to visit nearby castles and national parks. You can buy tickets online and the trains are easy to navigate to get to places like Peles Castle in an hour or so. Highly recommend staying here a couple weeks! I hope to return.",

I guess \"enchanting atmosphere\", as one of reviewers said is represented in a way of heaps of garbage everywhere, groups of sketchy immigrant people right on the main walking street (I've been asked for money two times already there by beggars) and I really lol'd at notion of \"it felt extremely safe\" in another review - I'm a tall man, and still I don't feel comfortable walking around a city in evenings apart from the main streets, gave me really \"i'm-not-feeling-that-safe-here\" vibes. And the best quality grocery shop in all center is this Lidl sh*thole? I can't even buy quality food...  And also yes, basically all the people here just don't speak English.  And I can't deny - there are quite beautiful places in Palermo, nice squares and there are cozy streets, and beautiful churches, there are definitely places to see and visit, but nevertheless... For example Trapani felt more safe and less dirty (even still quite dirty tho).",

    "descriptionFromReview": "I can tell you that Lublin, as the capital of the so-called \"Poland B,\" is often underrated and overlooked by many. It's well-known for its truck factory, but it also boasts a charming historical city center. Though it might not be as grand as Kraków's, Lublin's city center is still worth exploring. Outside the city center, Lublin can be quite underdeveloped, limiting the range of electric scooter rentals to only around 2-3 km from the center. This is a pity, as there are interesting sights such as wooden crkva a little further afield that would be more accessible with expanded scooter range. If you're nomad it's most probably even easier for you to go dating here than overpopulated Warsaw.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Here nearly a week and feeling like I'm only just finding my feet and wish I had come here sooner. Tiny place that revolves around surfing and skateboarding (fishing isn't as prevalent as I was expecting and much less compared to Essaouira). It's also not as 'sleepy' as everyone describes and not as cheap. Everyone knows each other and it's easy to dig into berber culture. Start with the taxi rank manager and ask about pretty much anything. Moroccan's love to help. You'll be sold weed every 10 meters, make of that what you will. Best things to do here are eat, surf and relax. Seems like a lot of construction and investment is going into this place so catch it while it's 'quiet'. I'd avoid staying on the main street as it's loud pretty much all the time with dogs barking, cats fighting, etc. I found Booking (website) to be the cheapest accommodation but nothing beats landing and getting stuck in to find a place for even cheaper. There is no bank machine in Taghazout. One in the Radisson nearby (when it works) and the next closest is Tamraght (I found one that doesn't charge). Sunny and chill. Fun if you like surfing and relaxing on the beach.",

There is very little to do here, no great cultural sights, no great venues to attend. There is hope, though: Romeo and Juliet (written in 1597) was performed live here for the first time in history in February 2022... way to go Surat!",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Mumbai, August 28-September 2, September 7, September 11 2019.  Got a friend to pick me up at the airport, so I can't evaluate how well UBER works from the airport. Prepaid taxi from the airport is my usual recommendation, and if I was traveling tomorrow that is what I would do. Inside of Mumbai, UBER was my go-to app and worked well.  Autos (aka 'Tuk-tuks' in some places)  get around well and are cheap, some are also on Uber.  Be aware that unless you use a service like UBER, as a foreigner, the price will go up if you do not look and act like a local when you flag down your ride.  Food was varied and can be had in any variety, veg or non=veg, any nationality or region.  Alcohol is available if you seek it out (some places will even deliver it to you with your pizza :).  There are bars and night life in Mumbai that are fun, and feel free to get swept up in festival crowds in the earlier parts of the evening in major metropolitan areas. I never felt unsafe in Mumbai, but do not throw good traveler caution to the wind here.  Internet was spotty at times, but that may have just been my location.  The internet tunnel I  used worked, but YMMV.  JIO was my phone provider of choice, and it seemed to work all across India. The city is historic and modern, slow and fast, very very rich, and desperately poor. Although prices here are higher relative to all other places in India, I will return to Mumbai (Bombay), and you should too... no one person can ever see it all.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "- Relaxed city to live in and incredibly safe. Nice if you want access to nature in southern Taiwan. Not so much english but locals are very friendly and will always try to help you. - Lots of cheap food available but while some is tasty, most is highly processed and full of oil/sugar . If you want decent quality food, it won't be much cheaper than back home. Many restaurants have an order card, so if you can't speak chinese you can grab the card and a pencil and use your phone to translate the card and tick off what you want - easy as. - Nightlife is based around night markets, KTV, places to \"hang out\" etc with a handful of decent bars/clubs around if you're into that. - Traffic is much safer than countries in SEA but still not perfect. - Very hot in summer but winter has good temperatures (although increased pollution in winter). Lots of sunshine most of the year with little rain/clouds which is nice. - Internet is fine and it's easy to get an unlimited data sim for around 700NTD/month and hotspot yourself if you need it . - All healthcare professionals speak some degree of english.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Lived in Antigua for over a year and I absolutely loved it! It´s called the city of eternal spring because the weather is like a perfect spring day all year round. There are two seasons, rainy and non-rainy but in rainy season (May-Oct) it only rains for 3-4 hours in the afternoon then stops. It makes everything lush and green which is another reason they call it the city of perpetual roses and eternal spring. It´s a small city so very easily to walk and see everything. If you escape the center of Antigua, you have to go see the little Aldeas around like San Juan del Obispo, Santa Maria de Jesus, Ciudad Vieja and San Pedro de las Huertas for a more local experience. In the surrounding areas there´s Hobbitenagno, Santa Catarina Barahona and the Mayan/catholic diety San Simon in San Andres Itzapa. There´s Iximche nearby which are Maya ruins and Antigua is centrally located to go see other breathtaking spots in Guatemala like Lake Atitlan and Monterrico. The local people are incredibly nice in general and especially to tourists. Antigua itself is very safe with it´s own division of tourist police, among local, state and federal police. Internet can be a challenge sometimes but when I was there in 2022 they started installing Fiber Optic Internet by a company called Innova so it was getting a lot better. There are a few co-working places like Selina and others that cater to digital nomads so if the internet isn´t super fast where you are staying there are a handful of places that have you covered and hopefully more soon with fiber optic internet. If you´re looking for history, beauty, nature and a more peaceful way of life, Antigua is your place! But venture out from the city square because the valley Antigua is in has so much to offer.",

I saw only a handful of westerners / tourists in my month (June) in Alexandria. You order everything. Food ie meals, groceries, clothes everything seems available 24 hours. People are nice. It's unique and different world. I thought it would be similar to Turkey. It's very different to any place I have been to.  Note I would choose Alexandria over Cairo just for the weather (I was here in June). ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Did the previous reviewer say world class art and culture?  Where would this be because after 2 years there, I was craving art and culture.  Like, my experience is the polar opposite so unless art includes street statues that happen a month of each year and if by culture meaning you run into a single black guy on the street, I don't get it.  It's really white, very few Hispanics, almost no blacks and few Asians.  No museums (outside of historical ones).  Most of the Mormons live in Provo if that matters. There weren't really any sketchy areas I've encountered in SLC.  SLC is a good city to visit especially if you're skiing.  If you're not skiing, I don't know what else you can do.  I found the city to be quite boring.    The national parks in eastern and southern UT are gorgeous but we're talking 4-8 hour drive away. Skiing is great. I personally like Park City but it's boring there too. Dating sucks all around. Between recovering Mormons to Mormons, there aren't a lot in between even if the city attracts non-mormons to work there.  And if you're not white, it'll be a struggle in the dating scene.  SLC nightlife is dominated mainly by college kids.  There's only 3 places that I'd consider hanging at as a 30's and up nomad and they're not very close to each other.  It's a walkable city although things are a bit spread apart.    The new SLC airport did not consider those who fly on airlines other than Delta. It's a 20 minute walk to get from check in to the furthest gate in terminal B.  Imagine old folks and handicap.  Crazy.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Have been in Weligama since Feb 25th and now I'm still here with the COVID-19 curfew going on. Before the curfew starts I was eager to get out of here because 1) it's too hot mid-day 2) tuktuk drivers are waiting around every corner asking \"tuktuk?\" and always horn at you when you're walking by the street - super annoying and 3) it's difficult to find workable wifi 4) everything just seemed super slow and it was hard to be productive.  But after the curfew starts I actually like it way better because 1) the traffic noise dies and 2) I found myself a place with good wifi right next to the beach. The locals (besides pushy tuktuk drivers) are very friendly though often times their English is too limited to understand you but they still pretend they understand just to be \"helpful\". It's also a great place for learning to surf (I made some real improvement with my skills).  The nomad cost is not accurate here. Expect similar or slighter lower cost than Chiang Mai, unless you're eating veggie rice and curry every day.  In summary it can be good for living and working if you spend the time to find a place with good wifi or get your own boardband. ",

Just like most Capitals in Latin America (Mexico City being the exception), it's not worth visiting much time. If you want to experience what the Dominican Republic has to offer (Beaches, Nature, Friendly Locals) as a nomad I would recommend Las Terrenas or Cabarete.",

I noticed a lot of black folk in Palma, presumably vacationing there. When I got lost I was graciously helped. It was very hot there—June 2023. Not much on the architecture front. Besides the central part of town, housing was rather plain and even ugly. Some of the small towns I visited were also rather plain.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Spent the month of September here and it was nice for the first 2 weeks.  There are a lot of young people due to the multiple universities and you smell weed everywhere!!! There is also so much construction going on with the roads and buildings, so it’s best to walk and bike most places.  The BIXI bike system is awesome!  There are also a lot of homeless screaming at people randomly in the streets.  Food and rent is expensive.  The “European” vibe is isolated to a 3 street area, but the rest of the city is much like a normal downtown.  Everyone speaks English, so super easy to get around.  2 weeks here is plenty!!   I was hoping for more of a European vibe.  ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Mauritius is indeed a great place to live in as a Digital Nomad ! They have recently released the Premium Visa for digital nomads that allows to live on the island for at least 1 year (renewable). Best places to live in are the North (very well developed with all facilities and business centres) and the West of the island (more for those who prefer to surf the waves and hike the mountains in between 2 video calls !).   The Mauritians are very welcoming and smiling people. I am not the first one to be touched deeply by their generosity. Food is very nice, people are helping, music and culture are the best. Wind in the South is perfect for kite surfing, wind foil, windsurf, etc  There are also new coworking spaces opening all around the island and you can hop from The Hive coworking spaces to a nice South African café such as Bloom in the North or to a tea place/colonial house such as Les Aubineaux in the centre of the island. All with nice wifi and great vibes.   My personal recommendations : visit the tea factory of Bois Cheri, taste the Vanilla Rum of Saint-Aubin, hop in the beautiful lagoon of Pointe d'Esny, and hike Le Morne at sunrise. I cherish every single one of these visits.    I would also recommend to be accompanied by an agency to get your visa, find a trusted real estate agency, choose your local insurance, etc. I asked Smart Traveller, they are specialised in helping digital nomads come settle in Mauritius and they were the best. Young and friendly team, professional and human. Cannot recommend them enough actually.   Still a great adventure to be here in Mauritius working remotely and a dream come true for my family and I.

I don't know how this place made it to nomadlist. However there are nice cities around which seem nice destinations for nomads like Gliwice, Bielsko-Biała, Pszczyna, Żywiec. Moreover coworking space listed here on nomadlist - Wirtualne Biuro is not a coworking space at all. As you can read on it's website (adding URL blocked in review unfortunately) \"This is not a drop-in scenario for the homeless digital wanderer looking for somewhere to stash the laptop and the rear end to do some work, but it is the place to make a virtual office with a prestigious address in the city heart of Katowice to impress those you may want to dazzle\". Locals seldomly get what being digital nomad is about.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "This was my first experience living in the Middle East. I lived here 2 years. It's such a diferent culture: the dressing, the food, the music, their traditions.   It's more modern than some other Arab countries but it is still a male dominant society. Female don't have a very active role in the public Jordanian society. Of course I met many couples where the woman is the dominant one and makes all the desicions, but it is the man that takes action in public.   As the minimum national salaries are around 300JD -395 Euros, I was expecting Amman to be cheaper, but surprisingly prices are similar to many Europeans capitals. Just housing can be cheaper depending on neighbourhood. Amman is a dirty, crowded, trafficking and a poor city with some rich well kept neighbours, like Abdoun. There is no much Middle class. It's a big contrast between luxury and poverty. And the government don't seem to care how can people survive with a salary of 300JD while the cheapest house is 300/ 350JD. The wives normally don't work. It's a family support  system.  Foreigns pay more in places like the Downtown. That used to be a more traditional area and now is more \"modernized\"due to tourism.  To avoid male attention, I would recommend woman  to just wear big cleavages and mini skirts in clubs and bars, in rich neighbours. Female foreigns  are considered easy and promiscuous for having boyfriends and not marrying virgin.  Arabs are friendly but that doesn't mean that they like you. They are very envious, love to brag and to show off and the majority is inexperienced. They leave parents home to marry. The ones that studied in university maybe are a bit different.  Traffic is crazy and people don't follow any rules. They just respect traffic police and red traffic lights. There are not many public transports . There are buses that are cheap but crowed and just used by poor people. Other option is uber. Taxis can be dirty and taxi drivers may smoke and talk on the phone while driving a client . There is no train or metro. So it's cars and people walking in the middle of the road s there are no side walks or zebras. side walks are used for stores, for trees or parking cars. Amman is not a walkble city.   If you have money to spend and just stay around the better areas, you will love Amman.   ",

For the most part, it's orientated around suburbian living. The main city (Johannesburg CBD) is for the most part a no-go because of crime, but if you know some locals you should definitely check it out there are amazing restaurants, theatres and museums to experience there.   Having lived here for 30+ years, I'd recommend checking out Sandton CBD, restaurants in Linden, Wanderers and Bryanston, and  rent a car to drive out to The Cradle of Humankind, and visit the Maropeng museum there. There is a lot to do here, you just need to think and act like a local.   If you are travelling to Johannesburg, I also feel like you'd be doing yourself a diss service by not planning a trip to The Kruger National Park. ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "I was in Anjuna, Goa for Feb 23 and I can only discourage you from going there.  We were recommended the place as an upcoming nomad place but it just doesnt work for nomads at all.  Internet is plain terrible. Even in the coworking (NomadGao, Clay etc) and a back up sim, you cant make calls reliably to save your life.  Next to no community there, but strong hippie and party crowd there.  The streets are very stressful and you have to be comfortable driving a scooter in hectic streets in bad conditions. The police will stop you daily if you look like a tourist to shake you down for money, driving license or helmet.  The value for money was the worst I ever saw. Accommodation was a real pain as no place would divert much at all from their daily rate, even with local friends making the negotiations for us. After a frustrating weel long search, we ended up spending 940$ for a month in a loud apartment by the street (lots of honking) just because the bathroom didnt reek.  Overall, if you are considering working from Goa. Just don't. ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Dirty. Hospital system is atrocious. Its like having a bunch of shiny glossy hospitals with poorly educated doctors everywhere. Most people end up going to 'Quickcare ER' places that are plastered all over town. Lets put it this way... The school system fast tracks people to become teachers in almost no time at all & they still quit in droves all the time because kids are out of control. Las Vegas desperately tries to buy status & sophistication but its always cartoony and not organic. Its a town of poorly educated people. It reeks of marijuana coming from cars everywhere, Attorneys advertisements look like they are more interested being in a fashion magazine than taking cases seriously. Suburbs are nice but schools/hospitals are no better there either. Plus the heat is too much for too long a period of the year. It feels like living under a loupe.",

You get about 2-3 months of fantastic weather, and between 5-8 months of absolutely oppressive cold. It has some decent local culture for its size, but a distinct lack of fun nightlife. Public transit is absolutely horrendous. People can be a bit close-minded. Quality of life is otherwise comparable to other big NA cities. Taxes are on the low side. It's very out of the way - there's no real reason to come here as a tourist because Calgary is closer to everything interesting.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "The city lacks footpaths in most areas. The air pollution is quite unbearable especially when you walk to go around or riding motorbikes. Petrol sold here only met the Euro 3-4 emission standard. Most vehicles on the road do not meet the minimum emission standard. The locals burn their rubbish which includes burning plastic. Everywhere is pretty much the rubbish bin for many locals. Infrastructures are not well maintained. Definitely not a picturesque city except for the trees planted in city centres. The \"parks\" here are more like green pockets surrounded by heavy traffics. Not quite functioning as a park where you can chill. It's a fairly safe city but nothing is particularly interesting. Most working spaces free from air pollution would be in shopping malls. But they're currently having many restrictions to get in (as of 9/4/2021). Houses here are not designed to bear the humid tropical heat and are heavily reliant on AC. Healthy foods are expensive therefore not accessible to everyone even though it is a basic human right. The overall quality of life I'd rate 5/10.",

(not including food courts in malls they are cheap) - If you want to cook the best places to buy food are the fresh markets and wet markets in terms of price.  - Stores like Tesco and Big C are cheap but again in the long run it adds up.  Attractions - Not too many places to visit here - If you have a car you can go to Buriram to see the historical places like Phanom Rung and other ruins  WiFi - A lot of free wifi in the malls and hotels - Hotel wifi - some are good and some are very bad even if it's a higher end hotel wifi can be bad - Mall wifi is fine - connects most of the time and sometimes it cuts off - the speed is okay - I found in general wifi allover the kingdom is pretty much the same in terms of speed and sustained connection",

The Sea Garden is amazing and you see so many people doing sports activities, jogging, gym in the park etc. The center of the city is the best part along with the Sea Garden, beaches are nice and has airport that starts to get traffic also in winter season. It is peaceful city and in terms of food and friendly people it is great. The downside is during winter you have not much to do and I have heard there are sometimes shortage of water for locals.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Porto Alegre (POA) is a city brimming with beautiful Nature. Trees and birds galore. Unfortunately, there is much wasted potential where historical architecture and intelligent zoning are concerned. I've traveled throughout Brazil and lived in Sao Paulo, and I can attest that POA has the best food hands down. Customer service is top notch, and the shopping is good. Love the vintage stores and antique shops too. Sunsets on the lake are a treasure.   Gauchos are the most \"talkative\" people I've ever met in my life (and I am a world traveler who has lived in other countries). Being chatty isn't a bad thing, but the problem here is that the vast majority of people only talk about THEMSELVES. Oftentimes, non-stop. They don't ask questions about you because they have no interest. It's about showing off where they've eaten, traveled, studied, etc. Even the taxi and Uber drivers behave in this manner. Living in a city full narcissists / braggarts gets draining.  After years of being here, I've arrived at the conclusion that it's cultural (not malicious). Aside from this, they are very nice people. NOTE: In the countryside, the Gauchos tend to be polite, modest, and well-mannered. ",

Not the MOST exciting city in the world, but certainly a lovely place to stay and take it easy for a couple days or weeks and get some work done. My favorite part of the city was the canals that run through certain parts, they were really pretty and added a lot of character and there were oftentimes bars/restaurants along the water or trails for running/walking/biking. There are a lot of good restaurants and bars, the people were all very friendly, and we had fun going to an area of town called Digbeth one night - it's a very hip area with a lot of bars and of cool graffiti. Not a ton of sights to see, and of course you can expect typical UK prices, but a very nice place never-the-less! I'd recommend staying either somewhere near the canals on the western side of the city, or right in the city center. ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Lake Balaton is Eastern Europe's treasure, an expansive freshwater lake that offers a medley of activities and experiences for both tourists and the growing nomadic community. But there are a few pointers and oddities that digital nomads, in particular, should be aware of. 🌍 **Neighbourhood Map Inaccuracy**   Firstly, I was quite surprised to find that NomadList's neighbourhood map for Lake Balaton is somewhat inaccurate. For a start, it glaringly omits Siófok, which is probably the largest city by the lake. Siófok isn't just a popular summer destination but an essential point of reference for anyone considering Lake Balaton as a potential remote work destination. 👩‍💻 **Co-working Spaces**   To my knowledge, the region's most notable coworking space is \"AZ iroda - Közösségi Iroda, Coworking Office Balaton\", conveniently located in Balatonfüred. It's a charming, functional space that adds a touch of modernity to the largely traditional locale.  🏖️ **Attractions & Activities**   Lake Balaton has a range of neighbourhoods, each brimming with its unique attractions. Swimming, fishing, and sailing are the staples here, with the lake's calm waters inviting all and sundry. For the thrill-seekers, the hyper jet 800 HP boat tours offer an adrenaline-infused experience of the lake's vastness. As the sun sets, the lakeside towns, each with their distinct character, beckon with their laid-back vibes and scenic views.  📡 **Connectivity**   If you're relying on internet connectivity, here's the deal: Mobile internet speeds are impressive if you're equipped with an EU SIM. However, WiFi in public places, cafes, and hotels can often be disappointingly slow. So, a good cellular data plan would be your best bet. 👩‍💼 **Nomadic Potential**   Despite its charm, Lake Balaton hasn't become a hotspot for digital nomads. Perhaps it's the tranquillity or the seasonal attractions, but it feels more like a place for relaxation and holidays than intense productivity. That said, its serenity, combined with its budding infrastructure, gives it untapped potential. 🕰️ **A Blast From the Past**   A peculiar charm of some parts of Lake Balaton is that they feel as if they've been preserved in amber since 1989. This has both its pros and cons. On the upside, there's an authentic, untouched feel to these places. However, the flip side is that they might lack some modern amenities that digital nomads take for granted. Most people are super friendly, more friendly in ex eastern block countries, however some are still stuck in homo sovieticus mindset. Also there are some tourist traps, beware. **Verdict**: Lake Balaton, with its quaint towns and vast expanses of freshwater, is more of a holiday destination than a digital nomad hotspot. But with a few tweaks and broader awareness, this Hungarian gem could shine brighter in the nomadic world. For now, it remains a delightful secret, ideal for relaxation and short-term stays. ⭐⭐⭐☆☆",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Izmir is off-the-radar of many tourists and nomads, but it has a lot to offer. It's relatively affordable, and it's warmer in the winter than many other parts of Türkiye, it has good public transit, decent food and shopping options, and reliably fast and stable internet. It's also a good jumping-off point for a day trip to Çeşme and several Greek islands that can be reached by ferry. You can pay by card nearly everywhere except the Izmir Metro, Izban — even for small purchases of 50¢ (currently 16TL)  Things that might turn you off: 1. This is not an English speaking city, even among the young university population. You can get by, but you are unlikely to strike up intricate conversations with most locals unless you're attending a language exchange meetup or hanging out near an English school. If however, you are looking for language immersion, I can recommend a homestay and/or making friends with locals here. 2. Turkish people love to smoke. If you want to hang out at a cafe and work, particularly outside most people are lighting up. 3. Internet in Türkiye is censored. Even sites like Booking aren't available without a VPN. The big ones that the government knows about may also be blocked. On the same note, connecting to public wifi requires personal information including your passport, and to be able to receive SMS 2FA, so if your foreign SIM does not have service, you can't use these APs. 4. Pork is really only available at the upmarket Macrocenter supermarket. Every restaurant offers halal as a default, and their version of pepperoni or sausage is all beef based. Beer and liquor, however, are available in every corner store and supermarket. I don't know why.  If you do decide to buy a Turkish SIM, only Tourist plans are available to foreigners without residency, with an inflated price of $21 just for the SIM and activation. (Though the data packages can be competitive.) Therefore, for short visits, it might be more economical to use one of these world roaming eSIMS, which I don't normally recommend.  I wouldn't recommend using the expat FB groups to find short or long-term housing because they are cryptic and never list the price in the ad. Though maybe you'll ask around and find one by word-of-mouth instead and get a better deal, more in line with Turkish incomes.  Lastly, do try to integrate in your local community and chat up locals. Don't be the digital nomad that doesn't talk to anyone. You can live anywhere. This doesn't mean that you need to behave like the place you left behind.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Some feedback how Kuching looks like from my perspective these days (because I guess city vibe changed a lot since covid):  Place has a lot of potential but as of right now (mid-2023) it is just OKAY but kind of boring for staying longer than 1 month and having a base here for solo nomads. I was ready to bail after 2 weeks but committed for 1 month anyway  1. SOCIAL/COMMUNITY This was the biggest drawback for me. - There is no any community right now (or is dead by now), I'm not talking only about DN community but also there is no any FB Hiking Group, Board games group, Couchsurfing group etc. - Get ready you won't meet ANY nomads within 1 month even if really trying hard and asking on different FB groups, Slacks etc. - There is barely any couchsurfing travelers. Most people come here for 3-7 days, most of them are couples. Couchsurfing hangout is dead - met only one local girl and she told these days maybe 2 people a month wanna hangout - If you travelling solo you will get bored after 2 weeks. - there are some expats but mostly those are 50/60+ years old retired people and all expats even those younger mostly only active in their inner circles - found it hard to make any friends with locals. Even when starting conversation yourself feels like pulling teeth... - dating apps (tinder/bumble) also not helpful to get someone to have a coffee or lunch - looks like everybody has long covid, depressed or lazy to get out of home and do anything during weekends  2. COWORKINGS There are 2 good coworkings (as a space): thegrounds and icube but:  Shared CONS: - both are mostly empty (most of the time only 1-2 locals in open space, other locals in private offices -> you won't have much interaction with them) - both open only from 8.00-18.00 and closed during weekends. - zero initiative - no any members lunch or trying to make community alive  ==Icube - has WIFI speed only around 10MB/10MB (seems limited per user) - only allow to login to WIFI with one device - it's more far away from oldtown (but no problem if you have motorbike) - hot desk are big NO NO - those are tiny circular desk and plastic chairs that are only OK to have a tea and chitchat - cold desks are good but they have only 13 sits for those - most are rented by locals/companies but not used for 90% of days in a week -> I was only one nomad, place looked empty but still it was the last cold desk I could rent. During my 2 weeks on average there was 1-3 other people in open space  + on the good side cold desk is very cheap and the price per week is pretty much the same -> don't need to commit for 1 month. But I don't like fixed desk -> harder to get to know someone if cowork is mostly empty + downstairs lots of shops for having a lunch + having more startup vibe look  ==The Grounds - freaking cold air-con (had to go with long pants and shoes instead of shorts + flip-flops and still felt cold) + pretty much inside downtown - don't need transport if living nearby + more modern look than icube + have 5 days flexible pass  2. INTERNET I would say overall mobile internet is slow in Kuching. I tried both Digi and Yoodo (by Celcom). Even though speed test was showing 10MB/10MB often everything was very sluggish even when signal was strong (just simple website browsing, restaurant images in google maps, etc.)  3. ACTIVITIES/NATURE - closest beach is ~40min away on motorbike (too far away to randomly each day go to see sunset and it's raining most of the evenings anyway), all beaches are very 'meh' (I though Penang or even Langkawi beach is meh but Kuching was even lower league). Probably not safe to swim (they have warning sign about \"watch out crocodiles\") - even if you busy most of the week you can tick off most places worth to visit within 2 weekends - nothing spectacular, sure there is wildlife center to see orangutans (if you lucky) but that's event only for like 2h - national parks are ok but e.g. bako national park has only 2 routes open (those more interesting are closed) - borneo culture museum or sarawak culture center was ok but nothing mind blowing (and not cheap) + the only thing that I liked is waterfront area during evening, musical fountain and vibe around there.  Now go search instagram for hashtag #Kuching or #sarawak for inspiration -> probably you won't find many interesting spots that are \"must see\"  4. WEATHER - at least in whole May was raining a lot! pretty much every day mostly after 17.00 though. Raining is not like raining in thailand or indonesia that after 15-30min it stops and after another 30min everything is dry. When it's raining it will be raining probably for 1-2h minimum. This makes evenings more boring and need to force yourself to get out especially if you are on motorbike  5. COSTS - not easy to find some decent accomodation on AirBnB for $1000 or less. I stayed in Kozi Square (many airbnbs there) for ~$550. Room was ok but tiny but a little better than most average hotels. I recommend to just rent Hotels weekly around waterfront instead  - motorbike for 1 month is around 600 RM but that's semi-automatic, if you want automatic it's 800 RM. Can drive only around Kuching. The semi automatic was very good though (waterproof phone holder, and waterproof storage in the back) + lots of hotel choices for around 20-30$ in downtown so don't have to commit for 1 month  As a rule of thumb cost of living is similar to Penang (though in Kuching accommodation rental cheaper) and around 2-3x of cost in Chiang Mai  6. TIPS a) don't commit for 1 month upfront, better just commit for 2 weeks, see how much you like it or if you click with someone and then decide if worth to stay longer or go to e.g. Sabah instead b) choose accommodation in walking distance to waterfront (oldtown/chinatown). This is where city is most alive in the evening and even if you are 5min away on motorbike like me was, it's still better to be there because often raining and easier to meet some random travelers randomly walking c) this is not Thailand. Many places closes at 15.00 or 17.00. Other only opens at 17.00 but stay open until 22.00. Most places outside of waterfront area will be closed very early (before 18.00). Even most food places around iCube cowork closes before 18.00. The good things is that easier to find place open for breakfast. d) you will probably have better experience if not traveling solo but with partner or travel-mate and co-living (can share nicer flat and car, feeling less boring) e) consider first 2 days staying maybe in some nicer social hostel - at least you can maybe meet some travelers and do something together. Or even maybe renting better single room in some nicer hostel if you are solo nomad (even if it's less comfortable than having own studio/condo) f) many AirBnB places have not good WIFI (because using mobile internet instead of wired) - double check it before renting since remember coworking spaces are only open between 8.00-18.00 and closed during weekends.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Oh Vadodara (Or Baroda if you have an old map)... I was there September 8-14, 2019. A friendly and beautiful city, but it helps to have a guide. I did a hotel stay as the prices were a tiny percentage of the same accomodation in Mumbai.  Internet was good.  Tunnel worked here (but that may just have been my access point). There are internet cafes (Cafe Coffee is one)... but there is also Starbucks.  Prices at restaurants are lower than other spots I visited in India. I did not do the street food here, but thats just me. By nature this is a very vegetarian region of India, so be prepared... however, they sure can cook, so you may not miss it.  I came in by train from Mumbai, but the airport has a fancy new (and empty) terminal. Get around by UBER or Auto (tuk-tuk), but you need cash for the latter.  There was flooding in August, the month before I arrived, but all was well by early September... keep an eye on the monsoon forecast.  The historic sites are stunning, the mosaic tile work, etc at the palaces... and please realize that they were only built around 1900 (yes that palace photo above in Nomadlist is a building built in 1900 by a British architect, not 500 or 1000 years earlier... but it IS gorgeous in person).  I will return to Vadodara again... but I'll give you a tip- pronounce it as Baroda and you will be fine.",

I’ve been to Malmö multiple times and would say that I always feel safe during the day, but there are pockets I wouldn’t be so comfortable going to at night. The area close Triangeln Station is one place I didn’t feel so comfortable. Most of the center is fine though, I’d say — though I feel like the city has gotten worse since I first visited in 2017.  Lots of good food options and easy to cycle around. I personally couldn’t see myself living here as the only reason I would is to be near Copenhagen, but it’s an enjoyable day trip. ",

I've been to all the Balkans, and Podgorica is probably the most \"meh\" and uninteresting city I remember visiting. Abandoned building without windows right on the main square of the capital of the country, are you kidding me? Really boring and although there are some things to see, but overall it's extremely generic, and you'd be better off going to other cities of Montenegro instead of Podgorica. Kotor for example is much more interesting, as well as some other cities on coast, or nature on the north.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "I work in Fukuoka and all I can say is that it's a fantastic city. As a disclaimer I happen to be close to fluent in Japanese, and as the metrics here would indicate speaking next to no Japanese might be somewhat difficult, but it's certainly still livable (tons of signage is in English, and there is information on places to go and see in English as well). Also it feels a tad more unexposed in comparison to some of the more major cities, though Fukuoka has a pretty large population at about 1.6 million inhabitants. I find it incredibly affordable (but I hail from NYC), and there is a lot of green space in close proximity to urban areas, which gives the city this really organic feeling to it- the perfect mix of big and small city. Food is without a doubt exceptional. Incredibly rich culinary history and culture here. Coffee is also terrific (may I recommend ManuCoffee? I used to work in a coffee start up and I still think Manucoffee makes one of the best blends I've had the pleasure to drink in a while). As another reviewer stated, these low key coffee places are often optimal for getting work done/studying/etc. and I often frequent them for this reason. I would say of the major Japanese cities is certainly one of the most livable, and with an airport 15 minutes away from the city center by subway it's very accessible and you can quite easily get around to different parts of the country from there.   As for cons summers here are quite tough. Brutally humid and hot. Winters then get quite cold, but there's rarely snow.   I remember the first time I came here I was visiting as a tourist but even as I work from here the same mellow, free feeling predominates. Lovely, lovely, lovely city. ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Nice and clean modern city. Nothing about it fitted my preconceptions I had as a European about Brazil: I though it'd be dangerous with favelas everywhere. Of course this is South Brazil so it's rich and very different than the North. Curitiba feels more like a Western European city than anything. It can get quite cold in the winter (which is June/July/Aug for Europeans). It has great public transport, and apparently is known for its modern urban planning that grew it from a small town in the 1950s to almost 2 million people now. People are friendly, and service is nice, especially if you try speak a bit of Portuguese. People in Curitiba generally are known to be a bit more stuck up / arrogant than rest of Brazil, but to me they felt quite friendly. Then again anyone is friendly if you're used to service in Lisbon.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "I spent a month here. I think it's a livable city but I don't know the value of living here long-term compared to other cities in LatAm.  Pros: - Great bar and restaurant scene. Coffee shops are really chill. Service is really good for the most part, but everyone is too cool to be friendly (hipsters). - It doesn't feel too unsafe, especially if you're not out late at night. It's no worse than any US coastal city. Maybe even safer. (came from Chicago, definitely safer than Chicago) - There are some American/European expats and tourists here, but it's not like Mexico City levels. You will need to go out a lot to find them. This can be a pro or a con. I think you really need to like drinking to meet people here as there isn't much else to do. - It's definitely a walkable city, but the public transit isn't super useful for an expat/nomad. Ubers are ridiculously cheap anyway and I never had a bad driver. You can get anywhere you need to go for a few dollars. - Climate, at least in winter, is perfect. Not too hot or too cold. Some people don't like how it drops into the 50s at night, but I don't really notice cause I'm a Northerner anyway. Though there are some bad air quality days if you're sensitive to that.  Cons: - If you stay in Colonia Americana or Providencia (and you'll most likely stay in either one of these hoods since they're safe and convenient), it's very yuppy. Yes, Mexico has yuppies. And that's not exactly what I signed up for visiting Mexico. So if you like Brooklyn and \"cool people\", this is the spot... me personally, I like a friendlier and less upper-class crowd. I don't find the people here particularly curious or eager to get to know foreigners even though there aren't that many tourists here compared to other major Mexican locations. It's not unfriendly either, I just think it's fairly townie. - The security culture is pretty intense here. Feels a little over-the-top compared to the relative safety. A lot of \"haves vs. have nots\" kind of vibe here... I don't really like that. I prefer a more egalitarian atmosphere. - Tons of grafitti in the central city. Definitely a lack of respect for private property here.  - Tourist sites are pretty boring if you're here for a short stay. I don't even think it's worth it to visit as a tourist or for only a couple of days. It's a good place to practice Spanish for a month, experience living abroad for the first time, or save some dollars in a place with mostly familiar amenities. - The cost of living is overall low here but Mexico has gotten a lot more expensive than it used to be. I'm not sure it's a great deal anymore. Cheaper than the US, but maybe only 15% cheaper than the cheapest mid-tier Midwest city (like a Columbus).  - The grocery situation isn't great, especially in Colonia Americana. It seems like people eat out all the time. - The best amenities are in the burbs but you probably don't want to live there. I did visit Zapopan and it feels a lot like a US burb. - Very liberal. Again, feels like Brooklyn. If you're not a lefty, this is probably not your city. - I think people drink and party and go to music shows here. If that's not your thing, it's probably going to be hard to meet people here.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "As the main gateway to Sulawesi and the rest of eastern Indonesia, Makassar is probably better for travelers than nomads at the moment. However, this is the place where I met the man, who turned me from a tourist into a real, hardened traveler. A local English teacher and prince with royal blood from the pulau selayar, this man organized a two month itinerary where I traveled to his students' villages, eating their food, sleeping in their homes and gaining a deep window into their lives that left me forever changed.  If you'd like to become a traveler, or gain a window into the real Indonesia, go to Fort Rotterdam and ask the guard to meet \"Daeng Lala,\"  the English teacher.\"   If you embark on this journey, bring your courage and an open mind, but remember that you are an ambassador of the west. Be respectful of the local culture, and understand that in Sulawesi, there is more than meets the eye.... it goes many levels deep. Good luck and safe travels....Daniel.  ",

From here, you can go to the famous Railay beach with a longtail boat within 15 minutes and also the tours to Phi Phi and Hong Island start from here. There is a club called Upbeat Bar/Loft RNB in the middle of Ao Nang that gets kinda busy, although not super crowded in the rainy season. Maybe main season is different. Stay away from Krabi Town however, its just an ugly town without anything to do and its not possible to get a taxi to Ao Nang after 10-11pm. Stay around Ao Nang!",

It really feels like a car centric dystopia with absent of trees and way to much construction towards the european classical colorless Bauhaus minimalist architecture that slowly will kill peoples soul (Which is really sad because the classical buildings in Malta is quite beautiful and characteristic). People's favorite activity seems to be alcohol, gym's here are not that great, but they do exists. The best thing about Malta is the cheap air plane tickets out of the island so you can go an explore more interesting countries around in Europe. Bolt / Uber is cheap.

    "descriptionFromReview": "Renting a flat as a freelancer here is incredibly difficult. The city isn't small but there's not enough to do in my opinion apart from drinking and eating. Locals mostly keep to themselves and don't mix much. Not enough nomadlisters. The co-working space here is alright (Harry Cow is €20 per day) but when it gets busy with 4-5 people having meetings and generally not being mindful of others, it's headache inducing. A lot of homeless weirdos with dogs asking for change who will insult you if you don't give them something (just ignore them). Bad behavior from cyclists and motorists towards pedestrians in the city centre. I've not felt unsafe in the city at night but I have to remain situationally aware when crossing paths with the usual weirdos you encounter. If you are already in a group or joining one here, you'll probably have fun. As a solo, I don't recommend staying here more than 2-3 weeks, you'll get bored.",

They are burning in the mountains and you can see the smoke going up to the sky.  And in the city it is not much better, the air is very much polluted there as well. I tried many restaurants but mostly the food is not very good and the service is depressingly bad. Combine that with the rubbish you see everywhere (especially around the center) and Da Lat makes not a happy place.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "I really enjoyed my month in Cuenca, but mostly because I wanted a chill place to focus on work and practice my Spanish. there isn't much to do, but it's very clean and safe and there's music everywhere.  beautiful churches, people are very friendly (although very little English is spoke) and it's ridiculously cheap. they use the USD as official currency and it was easy to find a huge, hearty, multi-course lunch for $2.25. no joke. there are ice cream and pastry shops every few feet it seems. the park in the center of the city (Parque Calderon) is a nice place to sit and enjoy the atmosphere. not many gringos, although there is a decent population of american retirees. there's one street (Calle Larga) which has a few bars and restaurants that cater to americans and there are some touristy places around the park, but my advice is to avoid these and wander a few blocks away from the park for good, authentic, local food. one of my favorite dishes is a seafood and onion stew called encebolloado which is fantastic and costs about $5. the Airbnb I stayed is had 100mps internet which was great. the National Park (Cajas) is beautiful. I strongly recommend a guided tour (about $75) because the trails aren't marked well and the guides are full of useful and interesting information. be prepared though, Cuenca is 2500m (8000 feet) up and Cajas is 4000m (13000 feet) up so you'll definitely feel the altitude. I stupidly went on the hike less than a week after I arrived and it was brutal. I'd wait until you have more time to acclimate to the height.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Don't let yourself be discouraged by the reviews here! Most of them are untrue and very negative and actually they made me skip Santiago in 2022. I came to spend a month in February 2024 and it was amazing! Everyday I got impressed by how nice this city feels. I've been in every latam country apart from Venezuela. Santiago is for sure one of the best. The city is very developed, clean and organized at the same time has a lot of shops, nice architecture, museums, bars and places with a soul. It's safer than most Latam countries and the quality of life is very high (also better than in all of the latam countries). It's not expensive, I'd actually place it as cheaper than most (it's for sure cheaper than Brazil, Medellin, groceries are cheaper than most of the latam countries, uber probably more expensive). The city has a very good metro line, bike itau rentals, allowing you to go everywhere and is very walkable and bikeable, lots of parks and nice streets. There are also many places that you can visit around the city, with 1 hour to the nice beaches and 1 hour to nice mountains. About the common thing in those reviews \"boring\" - every big city needs to be discovered, one needs to learn where to go out, which park is nice etc. Santiago is no different than that. Once you learn how to manouver it, it becomes very lively and exciting. Some examples of party areas are: Manuel Montt, Lastaria (bars), Bellas Artes. The digital nomad scene is not very big compared to e.g. Buenos Aires or Medellin, but does it mean that's a bad thing? Sometimes it's even better because it's easier to make friends in 10 person groups than 200 drunk people groups. There are many international communities thriving here just check the meetup app which offers language exchange meetups or internations community where people organize for multiple meetups during the week, such as sunset hiking etc. ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "I live in Saskatoon.  It's brutally cold in the winter--do not visit.  That said, it's cheap and gorgeous in the summer (May to September).  Temperatures usually are between 20 and 30 Celsius during the day, and the sky is almost always clear.  The sunsets are gorgeous, and there is a riverbank corridor that runs through the city where you can walk for 20 kilometres along the river and never cross a street (it's called the Meewasin... If you like nature, you will want to book a place near it).  Bring bug spray, as there are lots of mosquitos in the summer, especially in the evening.  During the summer, there is also a lot more to do--there are often festivals like the jazz festival, the Fringe (theatre), Taste of Saskatchewan, etc.  There is not a ton of nightlife or other things to do--there are a couple of museums and art galleries, but it's a very small town feel.  Like everywhere in Canada, it's generally safe, LGBTQ friendly, and multicultural.  It's safe for minorities, although we have racism like everywhere (and Indigenous people--women in particular--have to be careful walking alone at night).  As a white woman, I have walked anywhere I want at all times of day or evening for my whole life, and not had a problem (although I have a high threshold for risk).  Canadian culture (prairie culture in particular) is polite and kind (you will be helped if you are in trouble) but reserved.  Making friends requires some kind of \"in\" (like attending a mutual event or a shared sport or something like that.  There are no dangerous bugs or wildlife (there are bears if you travel to camp--and there is much gorgeous scenery nearby).  There are three good co-working spaces, currently.  Two on Broadway (that is the trendy artsy area), and one downtown (called the Two Twenty).  The Stand on Broadway is my top recommendation for a cheap place to get wifi and work, and the Two Twenty is the most established and the nicest.",

But with a smartphone you can translate anything you need to say. Chongqing is beautiful, gritty and romantic. Extremely inexpensive and lots of things to do. Beautiful women. Maybe the most unique city in China. Weather terrible in winter and summer. Winter is foggy, rainy and low light while summers are uncomfortably hot and humid. They don't speak standard Mandarin here so even Chinese from Beijing can't talk to the locals. I had the time of my life here but it's too strange and foreign for many. Not like going to Thailand or the Philippines. It took a while to grow on me.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "I would say the cost of living in Winnipeg is pretty accurately represented. I live here, and honestly, it's a decent cheap Canadian capital, I can live while doing my hobby here, and sharing a house. It could be a lot worse if you're thinking of coming to Canada for a while, rent can be found relatively low cost and utilities are cheap too. Meals vary, of course the locals know where the good cheap places are, I like the $5 tacos at BMC market. It is flat and very cold in the winter so do be prepared, Winnipeg is merciless that way.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "I really like ABQ. There is a crime problem and people complain about it all the time, but if you choose your neighborhood carefully and lock up your stuff that can mostly be avoided. Fun, sort of weird vibe with a unique culture, fascinating history, and great food. Perfect weather year round with just enough of each season without too much snow or too much heat.  Bosque area or Sandia mountains are great for hiking, easy weekend getaways to New Mexico's  national parks (White Sands, Carlsbad Caverns in particular are fun!) and other areas to explore (blue hole in Santa rosa, Santa Fe, Native american ruins, etc), as well as southern Colorado and Arizona.  Its just a different kind of place than any other city. Good size and decent airport, but doesn't feel huge. Politically somewhat moderate- the north half of the state is liberal and the south and all the Texan transplants are conservative so it lands somewhere in the middle. Generally friendly locals and a nice melting pot of Native American, Mexican, and other cultures without a lot of judginess- very live and let live. And cheaper than almost any other \"big\" city in the USA. I have no idea how anyone chooses to live in Phoenix when the weather is so awful compared to ABQ, or chooses Denver when the cost of living is so high compared to ABQ. And Texas is too humid, so New Mexico is a nice little spot in the middle of all of it. ",

The food is amazing, everything is cheap. the uber is almost for free. The internet have some problems, but it'll depend of the area that you'll live. a lot of people speak English, even the apps have the option to read in English. The city is very safe, even for womans at 2AM on the street.  Never, never, and never believe in any seller or anyone that is trying to sell something to you. 95% of the sellers will try to scam you, so be smart with it. Accept the reality of the country and you'll have a lot of fun! It's a nice place. But the caos and the scams destroy everything. It's nice to live a while, but you'll need a huge amount of patient.",

Just 300 meters from the main street – you will find secluded guesthouses and small local resorts, which are completely quiet and peaceful.  Fast internet. And almost nothing to do :) which is prefect to finish important projects. Highly recommended for that purpose. No one will distract you from your task. That's quite cool. And still.. you have jungles, beautiful scenery, beautiful sea 5 minutes from your place(!), amazing sunsets, unbelievable variety of food (super cheap!!!), swimming pools, roads ro drive a motorbike without any traffic, super friendly people, place is extremely safe, and... a lot of other perks!   Accommodation: Never book in advance (just a hotel for first 2-3 nights). Ask the price per month in person! It's always 2-3 times cheaper, than booking our Airbnb shows. Great (I mean it!)  accommodations are just for 200-250$ per month! But only if you ask in person and bargain. It's Asia :)",

Everything is spread out far, and the city is beautiful, but the cars are definitely number one priority in the (rather young) Citys Architecture. Yandex taxi or busses will get you around pretty well. In winter you'll spend most of your time in cafes and work from there. I have to disagree with the suggested \"best coffee\" place. Visit \"Kul'tura Diktuyet\" in syganak street ten and ask Radmir for a cappuccino. You won't need to find any other coffee place after that. Great, fast, stable wifi, funny staff and you can work in peace as well. ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Its mediocre, generic town in a bottom 4 state in flyover country. The town is at about 71K and its boring, the music scene is almost nonexistent, and the genre is usually country/twang southern rock. There is SkyPAC and Capitol arts, but they are mostly centered around the Boomer demographic and needs. Very conservative politically and socially. Churches everywhere, bible study groups and people trying to convert you if they see you are a non-believer or of a different faith. Lots of smokers and sus looking people. Lots of jobs, but almost no careers, think service sector. The town is run by the same wealthy white boomers since the 70s. And it's still corrupted like it was in the good old days. Homes are becoming overpriced. Almost all the new construction in the town to accommodate the influx of people has been generic apartments and a series of fast food, car washes, and credit unions. WKU ranks bottom 25% in the nation. It basically a community college with a Panda Express. The school system is mediocre, run by teachers who phone it in. If you're not in AP classes, you're not going have many prospects for post-secondary education. Town basically shuts down around 8-9Pm on weekdays and 11-12 on weekends. There are some attempts to improve the situation, but the more open minded are running up against the close-minded boomer bible thumpers who have the majority.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "The town has been taken over by tourists. Local music venues that have been around for 50+ years are closing because they can't afford the rent hikes. Tourism + out of town developers are driving prices for locals up and the job market can't keep up (minimum wage is still $7.25 an hour.) It would be possible to increase minimum wage, protect small business, and local cost of living if the state wasn't controlled by conservative republicans who won't pass any useful legislation to aid with the economic divide. But sure, let's spend  $500 million to build a brand a second football stadium. I digress.  If you do visit, please stay at a hotel instead of an Airbnb. Low-income neighborhoods are being bulldozed and gentrified by developers to build 4 story houses ideal for investment property owners seeking to rent it out as an Airbnb. (This impacts pricing for both local home buyers as well as renters.)  Last, but not least, PLEASE tip service industry workers (servers, drivers, performers, bartenders, etc.) If you can afford to visit, you can afford to tip. Thank you!",

This bustling city is growing at an impressive rate, showcasing a blend of cultural heritage and modern infrastructure that offers an array of opportunities for visitors.  One of the city's key highlights is its small and friendly airport. The Rzeszów-Jasionka Airport is conveniently located, allowing easy access to and from the city. Despite its size, it boasts excellent connectivity with other European destinations, making it a perfect gateway to explore the broader region.  Food lovers will be thrilled to discover the authentic Neapolitan Pizzeria NOMO nestled in the city. This eatery takes pride in serving up the finest pizza, prepared following the traditional recipes and techniques from Naples. It's a slice of Italy right in the heart of Rzeszów!  Rzeszów is also home to a collection of amusing monuments that add a unique charm to the city. These quirky structures often elicit laughter and make for great photo opportunities, infusing a sense of fun into the city's architectural landscape.  However, a point of caution for those browsing the city images on NomadList: many pictures listed under Rzeszów are, in fact, from Warsaw, which may cause confusion. As a community, let's strive to accurately represent the beauty of Rzeszów by voting on the images that truly depict this vibrant city.  Rzeszów is indeed on an exciting developmental trajectory. Its growth, combined with its cultural richness and modern amenities, makes it a city to watch out for in the coming years.",

Nevertheless, basically no one speaks English.  There is a large mall with several options to eat and work.  I've spent days in local cafes without issue although cafe owners were clearly surprised by this behaviour.   Regarding activities, they are constrained to the touristic, such as museums, and hamams (saunas). I've heard that there are pubs and places to dance but I've not seen them.   The female population mostly behaves as small town people. Caring about appearances and stuff like that.   Be extremely careful with traffic! No rules are respected.   Finally, this nation has an honor culture, like all of the region. Do no criticize anyone for anything!",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Many people get the wrong idea about this city because they don't know where to go or stay at a touristy place. It's one of the best cities for me personally to live in (decided to move here full-time). If you still want to live in a city with it's amenities, but want to have the ability to run to nature within 10-20 minutes, this might be it for you. Yes, it's not cheap, and I would put Limassol into the exact cost of living brackets as Lisbon or Berlin. For long-term living, the costs are much lower because of lower local taxes (12.5% for freelancers and companies), while Germany has a 45% tax an example. Another main con is public transportation, hence you need to rent a car to experience the real Cyprus.  Pros: - Perfect for work/life balance (for me) - Beaches are in and around the city, you live in the middle of the island, so Troodos mountains, white sandy beaches of Ayia Napa, other cities (Paphos, Larnaca) are just a 1h drive away. - Rapidly growing and improving. A completely different experience from 5/10 years ago. Lots of great coffee shops to work from and improving internet connection (most coffee shops have good enough internet). - Some of the friendliest locals I've seen. On and they all speak English - The weather is great 95% of the time. August is too hot for most people and January/February can be too cold or rainy (15-20 C) compared to alternatives such as Asia - Nightlife improved drastically in the last few years with cool bars, nightclubs, tech/house or techno music, day parties, restaurants that have djs playing chill music and so on. - Very safe - Cyprus has this charming \"villagy\" vibe that Greece and other southern countries have, so don't expect to find Bangkok here:)   Cons: - Getting more expensive here (Berlin level). Other cities in Cyprus are much cheaper. If you live here as a resident tax savings cover for it. - Lack of public transportation. You need to rent a car to get around the places (Limassol is a very \"long\" city, so going from one point to another might take awhile). - Limassol still has some abandoned or not clean buildings that you could find in other Middle Eastern countries, but don't let that fool you. - This is not a con to me (even though I don't speak Russian/Ukranian/Belarussian): There is quite a community of Belarussians, Russians and Ukrainians fleeing the war, but most of the ones I met are super friendly and very nice. If you really don't like hearing Slavic languages, most of the nice bars and restaurants have mainly locals, Greeks or Europeans. Almost all of them are very friendly and come from amazing cities like Kiev. ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Visited in February of 2019, the week before Carnival. Great time to visit as there were hardly any tourists and only a few other travelers. Downside is a lot of the restaurants aren't open and some tours are shut down. Upside is you get to live like a local in a insanely touristy town 10 months of the year. We were able to grab a very nice 1 bedroom apartment in the old town center with a kitchen for 150 euros for 5 nights (30 euros/n). Probably 10-15 restaurants were open in the old town, including the main grocery store. It appeared most everything was getting ready to open for Carnival, which probably marks the end of the lowest season (Few days after New Year's to Carnival). We did all the touristy stuff, and saw no other International travelers but a few random couples and one Chinese tour bus that overnighted (Right as COVID was taking hold...) We walked the walls and saw less than 20 people in 2 hours. If you want to avoid the crowds you can't beat Dubrovnik in the winter.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Much cooler climate due to the altitude and a lot of good nature settings (some of the parks require 100 Pesos entry). Still has the comforts of a city with a big SM mall and good shops and restaurants. Absolutely packed in summer as it's a popular vacation destination for locals.  Getting around can be difficult because only taxis are allowed, not ride-sharing, and the taxis are in high demand. Grab app only shows taxis and often fails to secure a ride. That said, the city is compact and traffic does flow well, probably because of the ride-share restriction!  For mobile internet, I found PLDT Smart works well. Globe rarely works at all.",

The birth place of many inventions like Penicillin, the English dictionary, the AstraZeneca COVID vaccine, MRIs, cloning and part of the science to invent the atomic bomb happened here. Very fundamental and important place to visit. Apart from that it's also just a cute uni town with little pubs and cafes full of students. Very magical place to visit. Not sure about living for long term but most uni towns are nice and lively to live so probably Oxford too! 8/10",

It is cold, winters are absolutely depressing, it is getting exponentially expensive, AfD is rising in power in Saxony and even in Leipzig and if you don't have neo-nazis, there are the extreme left which are equally depressing, especially for more liberal minded nomads. People from Berlin move here because Berlin is becoming crazy expensive, not because Leipzig is so cool. I fail to understand the hype around it and this nonsense has to stop.

    "descriptionFromReview": "I've spent the past four months living in Quito, and to be honest, I've decided that I won't be returning to this country again. My experience here has been incredibly frustrating, especially when dealing with the average Ecuadorian citizens. For instance, when you go to a store and ask for a specific item, you often end up with something entirely different. Additionally, using Uber has its challenges, as many drivers keep their phones in their laps, constantly glancing down at the GPS instead of using a phone holder for safety.  While I've always had a love for dogs and grew up with them, my time here in Quito has led me to develop a genuine fear and dislike for them. It's not just the stray dogs causing issues on the streets; it's also the ones owned by people in lower-income areas. Many of these dogs are not properly controlled and have a tendency to randomly attack passersby. I had a particularly distressing encounter with a group of aggressive dogs during my third month here.  Moreover, if you happen to wear shoe sizes above 10 and a half, you'll face difficulties finding suitable footwear, as these sizes are rarely available anywhere in the city.  As for the dating scene, I found it to be quite lackluster, especially as a male. Quito doesn't offer a wide range of activities or a thriving expat culture. Most locals you encounter seem to be interested in forming friendships only to gain something from you.  On a more positive note, I did find some redeeming qualities in Quito, such as the ability to take quick trips to places like Banos and the overall cost of living. However, based on my experiences, I wouldn't recommend living in Quito for an extended period, as it doesn't offer much in terms of a fulfilling experience. You're not missing out on much by choosing to explore other places instead.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Having travelled and lived around Thailand and Malaysia, Malacca feels somewhat disjointed without any real centre apart from the touristy Jonker Street. Weather (January 2024) ranges between a balmy & breezy 28C to a slightly uncomfortable and sticky 33C. Local food is very reasonably priced (3.50 Ringett for sweet tea or kopi, 7 Ringett for a plate of noodles), if you avoid the most touristy places and stick to local side alleys and restaurants where the local people eat. People here are very friendly and interested to know where you come from, many speak good English. Big Chinese and Nyonya community here, which reflects in the food, along with Portuguese & Malay influences. Some of the longer-stay hotels are cheaper when rented through private landlords (find them on Booking website). Buying a traditional wooden house in the centre of Malacca near the canal costs from 12,000 Ringett (prices as of Jan 2024).",

Pretty good rec leagues (hockey, baseball, etc.) and probably the only city in North America with a full motocross track in the city centre. Also have kart racing nearby (Strathmore) and indoor/outdoor skydiving. Also lots of mountain biking, rock climbing, and hiking within a short drive (Maclean Creek, Drumheller, mountains). Obviously great snowboarding and skiing both in the city (Canadian Olympic Park) and nearby mountains.  For those who aren't into sports or the like the city might be a bit boring. The downtown core is coming back after the recession but still not as lively as many other metropolitans. Definitely a car based city once you get outside the city core but city is investing in subway system so that might get better in next few years.",

It is unarguably very different than rest of India, much more cleaner and with friendlier people. Beaches aren`t nice for bathing but are a great choice to catch sunsets everyday. Cost of living is dirty cheap and public transport is good. They even have a subway crossing the city with reminds me the BTS in Bangkok. Actually, Kochi to me is like a small and boring version of Bangkok, which is good if you need a cheap place to get the work done while enjoy the sunsets and South Indian food.",

It's colder than you can even imagine in the winter but that's a fun experience. Shoulder seasons are short, and summer is hot and muggy. Good food.",

Visit Café Clock, on rue Talaa Kebira (actually its located on a small street perpendicular to Talaa Kebira, simply look for the sign) We've been on the hunt to find high speed internet in Fes and the only place we've find is this great restaurant/cafe.  Internet speed was between 40mbs and 101mbs. A few electric plugs and a very nice menu (finally a place serving other things than tagine or couscous) Delicious vegan options, fresh juices, great ambiance, comfy couches.",

The amount of burning corpses everyday, together with cows in the streets, labyrinths of alleys and the typical dirtyness is something to be far from. However, it surprisingly attracts lots of foreigners. I stayed a whole week and it was my personal record. Good luck -- you will love it or hate it.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "I spent two months in Arequipa and loved most of it! Lovely people and a lot of nature around. The beautiful Colca Canyon is near, where you can also see the Andean Condor or book multiple-day hiking tours. It is close to Puno which you should visit as well and it's easy to go to Cusco from here, to see the famous Macchu Picchu.  For working it wasn't that great, unfortunately, with slow internet and the available coworking spaces not quite as nice as I had hoped. It's still okay though, so not terrible.  The city itself is nice. Traffic can be terrible at times and taxi drivers never have change (ugh...) but old town is wonderful and the zocalo super beautiful. There are some nice bars as well. Everything is cheap of course and the locals really friendly.  So all in all it depends what you are looking for but if you like nature and speak some amount of Spanish you should consider Arequipa for some time!",

You will get the best food in restaurants as well as streets. Internet and mobile recharge are also cheap in India because of JIO. Cloths you will be getting branded as well as normal with the best prices all over the city. Places to visit are a lot, can't tell one name because every place to be visited. The city is very neat and clean. Night outs are allowed unless you don't drink and drive on the road. If any police caught you they would leave you with the punishment of a fine. Please follow the rules when you visit. Devotional places are very good like Simhachalam, Kanaka Maha Lakshmi temple etc   ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Ahhh Medan. This little jewel in the rough is a place to get away from it all. No foreigners, just you. Maybe 10% speak English. Still, prices are good.  I walked into a 5 star hotel, stayed 3 days at the regular rate, then negotiated a rate for 30 days... 5 star perks for $29USD a night. I've been here 2 months now.  If you're a fan of Art Deco or Art Moderne, this place is great. The city is beginning a modernization process... slowly... just slowly enough.  There are 4-5 huge shopping malls (and a couple of dead ones :).  The food choices are wide and varied. The core of historic Chinatown, in Kesawan district,  is quite the place to shop or eat- there's food, fabric, motorcycles, musical instruments, sports equipment, cell phones (an entire mall for just cell phones).  Medan has a LOT of coffee shops, from little carts on the sidewalk to hipster joints in refurbished buildings (and Starbucks). Like the song by 'Missing Persons' says, \"Nobody Walks in Medan\". The scooter and motorcycle rule the road here.  Watch where you are walking (sidewalks are a bit rough).  Brastagi is the fancy grocery store. Indiatown is wonderful and the restaurant Cahaya Baru is the best Indian food since... well... India. The area was settled by Local Aboriginal Natives, Chinese, and Indians, and there is a great cultural mix with a lot of tolerance today, especially as time moves on from those dark days of the late 1990's Indonesia... out with the old, in with the new...Young people just wanna have fun now. Mosques, temples (Indian, Buddhist, Confucian), churches... Medan really is the most culturally diverse spot in Indonesia.  If you want to get off the tourist grid, really off, try Indonesia's 4th largest city.  Did I mention the active volcano? ",

Yer, It happens like Shx.all the time where ever you go! Locals are wise.. but expect it and order a double portion...Lol!   I am Tim Love from the UK and I have married an Indonesian beauty! We do not live together because the UK law makes it a terrible ordeal to fix...(ongoing issues) But, as I said... If you are WHITE.. then you must expect to be RIPPED OFF ! ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Mostar is a cozy place near the capital city of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  It is possible to go there by train and the view during traveling Sarajevo-Mostar is spectacular. Mostar has a small airport but is not functioning most of the time.  Hotels, hostels, and apartments are affordable and look good.  Food offers a lot of red meat, but it's possible to do a good combination of cheese, bread, salads, and seafood.  WiFi is not the best.  There are a few points in the town that should be seen but mostly Mostar is a service town with nightlife, restaurants, and coffee places. It's quite lovely all of it, but besides it, the town doesn't offer a lot.  However, this part of Bosnia is beautiful and it is possible to see the different places around by staying in Mostar. It's a small region and in slow motion, five to seven days is more than enough. I have been several times and springs and autumns are the best, while winters are quite cold even without snow. Summers are unbearable, but it's possible to be on the sea cost in 45 minutes by car.  Services in the restaurants and general communication (busses, cabs, hosts, hospitals, stores) are not satisfactory, but traveling around I figured out they just behave that way, it shouldn't be taken personally.  If you are an outdoor person, there are mountains, rivers, and walking tours you shouldn't miss.   ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "In Kolkata January 14-27 2020, staying within 10 blocks of the Park Street area. .  I was enchanted.  The juxtaposition of old and new, rich and poor, high-end retail and street fare was something to see.  Apparently one of the cheapest places to rent in India, although I fell back on a hotel (I know, not very nomad)....  Still, it was not bad. Internet was fast enough for research and posting work, but there are filters on access in various places in India, so for example I couldn't get my Tunnel to function here (may have just been my chosen access points filtered it).  There are internet cafes (Starbucks, etc) in the Park Street area that I could use. English is widely (but NOT universally) understood, but you will also run up against Bengali, Hindi, and Urdu. The food is fabulous, with every possibility you can imagine (oh yeah, nice brewpubs and pizza for the unadventurous).  Even if you are not a vegetarian, trust me, these folks can cook in ways that you won't miss meat (and this from a guy who likes BBQ). Currency exchange is best done at a bank, don't trust the ATM's that are stuck to the side of a building. Although the NomadList says otherwise, I was able to use my plastic for a lot of purchases- India is pretty progressive depending on where you are.  Use a \"Prepaid taxi\" to get from the airport to town, which you can get from a booth inside the main terminal... Don't use UBER at the airport as the crazy insanity of the pickup area makes getting your ride nearly impossible (otherwise UBER in Kolkata is fine).  I miss Kolkata, I will be back. ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "I have lived in Madison for many years and have mixed feelings about it.  It is a very clean and green city, and hospitable to bicyclists.  There are many parks and nature centers and an abundance of restaurants serving all varieties of cuisine.  There is quite a bit to do here, and Madison is also close enough to Milwaukee for day trips to explore.  I love the farmers markets and feel very spoiled to have access to so many locales from which to buy organic food (and vegan, paleo, etc.).  What I don't love is the racism in the public schools.  Madison is a fairly segregated city, which has been a huge disappointment.  Over the past three years or so, road rage has become a significant problem and the crime rate has drastically increased.  There has been a large influx of people moving to Madison, which has resulted in traffic challenges.  I loved Madison when I first moved here, but it is becoming increasingly dangerous and the housing market is definitely overpriced.",

Food is pretty cheap as In Germany in general. Summers are quite nice to spend around some lakes and river beaches.   Flight connections are amazing. Also airport functions even with staff shortages, not overcrowded.  You can get around without German language that's for sure. On a very basic level.  But having a conversation or dealing with paperwork outside of city-center can be tricky.  Crime is very low. There is a large party area. Some pretty fun clubs.   Probably for a nomad I would not recommend. A bit snobby/cold.   But for a short-term work-stop is okay.  Spacious and calm overall.   ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Been coming to Koh Tao for years, it's an under-rated island IMO.  Its small size makes it a great place to stay and remote work from.  Lots of great beaches, walking trails, climbing and of course scuba and snorkeling.  An amazing selection of restaurants, great coworks and cafes to work from.   Being smaller it helps you stay focused, spend less time travelling around etc.   I personally have never felt unsafe there and pretty much all the nomads I meet there say the same.   Power is much more stable than 7 years ago, for me it's never really been an issue.  Interenet to the island is usually 300-400mbps up/down for anywhere with a good router/wifi.  Getting an AIS SIM is a good backup if you need backup internet. ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Seattle is a great city, especially if you like nature, there are plenty of outdoor activities to do all year round. People are generally open-minded and friendly. The cost of living is high but it allows you to be able to afford other places on earth easily if you can find a job here. You can also find plenty of good restaurants and arts around in the city. I recommend to stay at least 3-6 months to  get the feel of living a PNW life. ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Gili Air is a wonderful tropical island with good enough internet, amazing beaches and affordable accommodation and food. The locals are super friendly and it's super safe. There is a party and live music every night for those that feel like socialising(with the exception of Thursday nights). There's a well equipped gym, Salsa dancing Night every Monday at the schick-kitsch mexican restaurant, stand up paddle, lots of wonderful yoga shalas, kite surfing, snorkelling, diving and lots of food options. It's actually becoming a vegetarian and vegan paradise lately. There's also a co-working space as part of a Yoga Center. Several music and traditional festivals are held every year and it's wonderful to watch local weddings. Land prices are also still reasonable given that the island will be developing at a faster pace now. The quality of people that seem to crowd Gili Air are very different to those that go to Gili Trawangan. Gili Air attracts a 30+ couples, families and friends groups who don't mind splashing out on nice accommodation, spa treatments and great culinary experiences. All in all, my favorite place so far with an average of 322 days of sunshine! The climate doesn't get any better than this anywhere in the world(and given most other exotic islands are prone to hurricanes... there's never been a hurricane or tornado in the Gilis). ",

Anyone who speaks in a derogatory way about the government, royal family or Islam will be deported (or jailed if they are Bruneian).  There is NO freedom of the press either.  Downtown Bandar is walkable if you don't mind the heat, but a car is 100% a necessity living in Brunei.  There is a small bus service that runs at apparently random times, but no other public transit in the country.   The English level is very good.  Almost everyone can speak English and it is the language of instruction in all public schools from kindergarten. ",

During daylight with other people I felt fine. There are soo many restaurants, interesting boutique gyms, cool libraries and more. The variety you can find in DC is closer to NYC than you can find most places. The memorials are pretty cool. There are a lot of free museums which are impressive. I liked the Lincoln Memorial/Gettysburg Address the most. It's expensive to live and participate in life here.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Vitoria is always in the top 5 Brazilian cities for quality of life, and has a unique neighbourhood kinda style in the areas in which nomads are likely to live and work.  Very walkable. I'd describe all the areas as cute, rather than majestic or big-city like, but they all have a nice, hip, kinda vibe that is great for strolling. Also much more difficult than in Rio to stumble into a bad neighbourhood. Lived here for 6 years and never had any problems. I walk and bike everywhere and never felt threatened. Pretty beaches and great access to nature. Good restaurantes, coffee shops, and nightlife. Short on musuems, football games, and big time tourist attractions (although the convent in neighbouring Vila Velha is really spectacular) if that is your thing. Not a huge expat community, but local people are very freindly. Live in Praia do Canto, Jardim da Penha, Jardim Camburi, Enseada do Sua, or across the bridge in Praia da Costa. Nice weather all year round. Pretty rich place, but cost of living much lower than Rio or Sao Paulo. Stay way from the suburbs, and favelas where there is a lot of crime (but why would you ever go there...). ",

As is the case with any Latin American country, you need to develop a 6th sense for your belongings and surroundings.

Plenty of good coffee shops for working in (Boscanova, Velo Domestique, Coast . Surf + Moto, L'arte Coffee).  A bit overpriced due to tourist economy, but still more affordable than London or Brighton.  One of the few British seaside towns which does not feel like a retirement home. Due to universities, it has a large amount of young people from continental Europe and South America. Good social scene.  Infrastructure is a bit lacking. With a poorly connected small airport and a 2-3 hour bus ride to Heathrow.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "TLDR; I wouldn't recommend for long-term stays.  First time in Cabo Verde (Sal), and I can't say I would recommend it for anything other than tourism or short-term stays. Don't get me wrong, it's lovely and exotic, and people are warm and welcoming, but it can get pretty boring after 30 days.    Cost of living is NOT cheap. Groceries are much more expensive than in any other places we've travelled to in the last two years. Restaurants are all the same price (around 30€ for 2 people) and pretty much serve the same thing. Food variety is not great.  If you come here for surfing, the waves are inconsistent at best and, at worst, non-existent.   On paper, it seems like a nice idea. In reality, it feels like locals and the government hired good marketers to sell the destination to digital nomads.   On the bright side, we had stable internet and it was sunny EVERY day. It's always windy in Santa Maria, so you don't need AC. Most people speak perfect English or understand at least.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "I’ve been to 14 countries across 4 continents and travelled most of the US and I must say Havana is probably the most incredible city I have ever been to but is probably better suited for a vacation than for nomading. It’s not difficult to find wifi as most airbnbs and restaurants have it but it’s not reliable if you have important video conferencing calls or need to constantly stream something.   Since most industries are publicly owned by the government, there’s a deep lack of commercialization that makes this place look so different from what you see in most other countries. Instead of large advertisements and billboards at every turn, there’s rich and beautiful art culture that makes just walking around and exploring this place the streets so enjoyable. Many people say that Havana feels like it’s stuck in the 1950’s which is definitely true since the classic city architecture and the vintage American muscle cars are all so well preserved.   If you admire live music then you are definitely in for a treat as there is usually so many talented musicians and performers at every corner and in most bars/restaurants.  The food is mostly seafood but it’s underwhelming as it lacks flavor. Cuban coffee & rum on the other hand definitely do not disappoint nor do the famous Cuban cigars if you’re into that.  Another huge highlight is the Cuban people. They are truly the warmest and most welcoming of any country that I have been to. Such a diverse community and everyone always a bright smile on their face and are so excited to welcome you to their beautiful country. Knowing Spanish definitely helps but there is usually someone around that speaks English pretty well and can help you if you need.  Yes there are definitely struggles with a lack of certain supplies and some infrastructure challenges but I honestly felt like it made for a more unique experience that I very much enjoyed.  Overall i’d say pros/cons  Pros: Beautiful city to explore Perfect weather Amazing people VERY safe (and not with cops at every corner) Quite affordable  Cons: Unreliable Wifi Underwhelming food Limited resources Need cash for all transactions  It’s probably not up to everyone but it offers a very unique culture and has such an amazing history to learn about. If you like good art, live music, and carribean weather, this is a great vacation spot.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Unless you want to spend the whole ski season in an outdated, tiny, crowded and poorly manage ski resort and terrible town and atmosphere, there’s nothing worth noting to do in Bansko.  Food is horrible, with no real healthy options to eat outside. Very limited and low quality products supermarket. Almost all restaurants have typical ski resort offers for all the British you will find here. Yes, tons of them come for vacations and the resort gets so crowded that even in the best days only a couple of hours have good enough conditions. And that’s if you can make it in the first hours. Even the “fast line” gets packed with tourists with “vip tickets” bought from some hotels and agencies. Long waiting hours await you not only in the gondola but almost every lift.  People are unfriendly, service is bad. You’re supposed to pay for a coworking to be involved in any social event. The “coworking Bansko” cult led by its weird founder is specially known for being extra exclusive and unfriendly with people outside of the coworking space.  The gyms are small and only one has good enough quality. It’s cheap, but it gets crowded easily due to its small size and limited capabilities. You won’t be able to workout properly if you want to do advance stuff.  Bansko’s overall price of living compared to its value it’s very high, not only because prices are not as cheap as you could imagine but because quality is terribly low. In my whole life of travelling I haven’t found a place where the standards for everything are so low.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "I’ve lived here for 11.5 years & been a landlord the entire time. A 1 bedroom starts at 1000, and that’s not in the city center. I have no idea why they’re saying it’s dangerous. There’s literally cops putting bike traps up to tempt people into stealing because there’s so little crime. It’s incredibly safe and welcoming to people of all races & genders.  It’s also dry, incredibly dry with forest fires in the summer so the smoke can be intense for several months. It’s not rainy at all like the weather on here states. It appears the map & hospital are linked to another Ashland not in Oregon. The photo is however of Ashland, Oregon.   Ashland is very white bread. There’s essentially no people of color or ethnicity. It’s comprised of people who took to spirituality instead of psychotherapy to work out their issues so there’s a fair amount of spiritual arrogance. There’s an infinite amount of spiritual workshops & endeavors.   The town survives off of tourism & weed. It’s often joked that there’s 3 women to every man. I don’t know if that’s accurate though it feels like it. Almost all married couples who move here divorce. It’s an incredibly healing place for women, but not a place for relationship as most remain perpetually single here. It’s the single mom capital of the US. The hospitals, at least the Asante one that owns most, are incredibly low quality. Drive to OSHU in Portland should you need a hospital.  ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "I've been living in Semarang for about 6 months at this point. Living at the \"Candiland Apartment\" which is reasonably priced 2.5 million - 3.5 million rupiah per month. Great view of the city. It's hot here. Usually like 35+ degrees. The beach is all industrial. Usually a lot of traffic. In the southern part of the city there are some small hills which are cool but to go anywhere with nice air, cool temperatures and big mountains it's at least an hour south. Sometimes the locals will give you a dirty look but if you smile at them they perk right up and smile back usually. There's not too much going on here in my opinion. But there are tons of nice restaurants with good views and the Tinder game here is strong. It has nice malls - I bought a new apple laptop here - quality is fine. Prices are good. If you like vegetables and non-fried food it can be both expensive and hard to find. All in all it's a pretty cool city. I could stay here but I've decided to move to Bandung instead with hopes of more green space, less expensive rent and a cooler climate.",

Locals can vary in friendliness quite a bit -- although being brusque with someone from the US mainland is entirely understandable.  Uber works perfectly well. The museums have very inexpensive admissions fees.  All in all, a good destination for a shorter (3 weeks or less) trip.  But not a place with a digital nomad community or lots of cultural activities.  ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "I stayed one month (28 male) in La Paz and during this time I worked in Selina Cowork. No problem with INTERNET, both at home and Selina I've had at least 20 mb/s on WiFi connection. I felt very SAFE compared to other latam countries, the city is very calm and also CHEAP. Bolivians from La Paz are very nice people, a bit more reserved but I was able to make friends anyway. There are no big expats groups / digital nomads, however there are some hostels where one can go for a party and meet some international people. Although the city is pretty small (less than 1 million) it's a good point to see Bolivia and area, it has great culture to explore there are comfortable buses going to Uyuni and other places in Bolivia, so it's a good point to see other parts of Bolivia. Especially that staying in the city gets one accustomed to the altitude. It's both amazing city and the country and makes for a memorable stay. ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "I lived Guatemala City and Antigua for 1,5 years, Guatemala city can be ok, if you live in the right neighborhood. But in general its not walkable. It's a city designed for cars, like in the US. It's very dangerous in certain neighborhoods, but it's not a problem if you stay out of them. The city is great for business, also really stylish apartments, there's a parallel high society living in a bubble there and if you're part of it, live is way superior to what you would know from home. Sadly poorer Guatemalans are a little depressed and introverted and the upper class wont talk to foreigners unless you are there for a longer term and do something important. Women in general are friendly there, very conservative and girl-friend material. Depending on the zone, this will vary a lot, like everything in Guatemala. I had an amazing time there, probably one of the best in my life.",

The rest of the year, most local businesses close their shops because there are no more tourists. Only malls are open all year. Most people don't speak English, so you are not likely to connect with people here. Many other cities in Romania like Bucharest (where I currently live), Cluj and Timisoara have much more to give.",

I lived there 6 mounth (being french) there is a lot of things to do, you can find easily cheap things to buy or do, people are relaxed, cool, but it's not safe, a lot of violence in the streets. The beach is really nice, parks are big and beautiful, there are nice museums, beautiful churches to visit too. You can take a little boat to visit other cities. \"Les calanques\" is a nice place to visit. ",

Boring town, super conservative and newly built strip malls that each feature 1 salon or beauty shop, 1 whitewashed mildly ethnic restaurant, 1 bbq or sandwich place, 1 store selling either vitamins or tangentially MLM related items, a tax preparation place, and 1 tea place.  Huge number of dental offices. Tons of big churches full of big hair, cowboy boots, and not a lot of anyone who seems truly to have faith, which I could respect. Decent population of college frat boys who call you ma'am.  As a city, it occupies the same mental space as a \"Target\" store but more racist. ",

Something about New Orleans always brings me back. Such a unique and one-of-a-kind place that while has gotten more expensive over the years, still is far more affordable than many places in the US. A lot of cheap good fun to have here and some amazing food. I will admit your safety factor will depend heavily on the area you're staying at.",

It has accessibility to lots of great outdoor adventures including hiking, biking, rafting/kayaking, hotsprings, and more. There are four seasons, but none too harsh. There's a cool downtown bar scene. Also, the highest concentration of basque immigrants in the world is in Boise, so there are some interesting cultural elements as well as great basque bars and restaurants. Because it is a smaller city, there are some limitations (not that many great restaurants). It is safe and a pleasant place to live.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "I spent one week there and it was more than enough. I stayed within 10 minutes walking distance to the center with its shopping mile and the Hilton Hotel. Internet was stable, but I didn´t feel comfortable at all. I felt a certain agressiveness, escecially on weekends. During the week I liked the area around the Hilton Hotel as well - some nice little restaurants and a great massage-place - but on weekends it deathquiet und you feel like an alien walking around. The best place is the roofterasse of the Hilton Hotel, were you can relax in one of the sunbeds and watch the sunset. It was the only place where I felt reallly safe. Noone is hussling you, you are on your own, dip on your drink, enjoy a good wiwi - but to be honest: thats it. ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Although I'm usually in Montego Bay, I always spend at least a week in Kingston whenever I'm in Jamaica. I've been there twice a year since 2017. Despite Montegonians warning me about how dangerous it is, using common sense, respecting the locals and their culture, and not being an asshat, unsurprisingly, goes a long way. I'm not big on tourist traps, but stopping by Devon House is a must. If it isn't for the history of its buildings or the beautiful gardens, stop and get an amazing curry goat patty or amazing ice cream. Accommodation costs vary greatly and I've stayed at both the C$80/night Spanish Dream to $300/night at Spanish Court. Longer term stays would benefit greatly from having a local Kingstonian's assistance. Transportation costs also vary based on the honesty of your taxi driver. Locals are generally friendly and I was lucky to have experienced the nightlife from the club scene to outdoor reggae parties, and local dancehall parties. I've never felt unsafe but I was also always with locals who knew their way around the city. Food is amazing and pricing varies greatly as well. The culture is not LGBT friendly and the internet infrastructure is spotty even in the better areas. I often found myself without solid access and simply used it as an excuse to enjoy myself versus working. Definitely a city worth visiting either way. ",

But I've spent a lot of time in Windsor so I can provide some overview. Windsor is a border town across from Detroit, Michigan, USA. A lot of day-trippers visit from other areas of Ontario and Michigan to visit the Caesar's Casino, which is a very nice casino if you're into gaming. Other than that there's not much to do other than enjoy the views of the Detroit skyline from the riverwalk. I always feel safe in Windsor. Like most of Canada, Windsor is expensive, but internet service and other infrastructure are great for working. Winters are extreme. Some Canadians have anti-American attitudes, unfortunately. If you're American be prepared to ignore these people and focus your time on the friendly locals.",

Lachania, Vati, Mesanagros and Arnitha all have beautiful squares with wifi where you can telework  sitting in a kafeneio under the shade of a tree.  In Vati there is free 5G in the square and no car in sight. You might see fallow deers grazing around. Perfect place to concentrate. Platanos taverna offers great home made food from April to November. It can get cold in winter and insulation and heating are hard to find. There are many stray cats in poor welfare and also suffering stray dogs. Driving is a bit aggressive. Alternative lifestyles are tolerated but not really accepted. However attitudes are improving fast.",

However, the downside is that it is a very expensive city. Basic items like fruits, vegetables, meat and even beer can be costly. Additionally, the import system in Norway is very protective, which means that grocery stores often only carry products that are made in Norway.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "I love Rishikesh, and it's a very pleasant place to live as a digital nomad. Prices are very cheap and it is lovely to have an ashram to go to every day. The flow of life is easy because I take with myself the backpack with the computer to a cafe by Ganga and have some nice healthy breakfast, at 08:00 am, and work to about 10:30. Then i go to Sachcha Dham Ashram join a Bhajans and listen to Satsang from my Guru there. Then i go out with my friends to a nice place to spend the day. Other days i work after that to about 5 Pm, and walk to Parmarth Niketan Ashram for som Bhajans and Satsang, and maybe a session of Yoga to, before i go to an restturant and have an evening meal before going home.   Now that i am older an have traveled on and off for over twenty years, i have found my home in Rishikesh, and i am suppriced that there is not more Digital Nomads there than it is, but i am pretty shure that that will change in the future :)",

    "descriptionFromReview": "I find the monthly cost of living numbers listed here are way off. In fact, living in Cannes is much cheaper than living in Chicago. Groceries are very affordable. Much lower than shopping at Whole Foods and probably by now, even Trader Joes.   Eating out, well, it can cost you a lot but there are so many affordable options. Rents can be high but again, there are many apartments that are reasonable if you are renting year-round. We have been renting Airbnb's during the winter months, from October to February, and were able to get a beautiful sea view one-bedroom for $1200. Another AirBnb a bit higher up again, for $1200. We splurged on a place with a large terrace and beautiful mountain view for $2300. But it was worth it! $2300 was about what my mortgage was in Chicago. According to Numbeo, cost of living here is around $4100 for a family of four.  By the way, Cannes is gorgeous with a sandy, accessible beach, people are very friendly, and it is meticulously maintained. We have been to Aix-en-Provence, Marseilles, Montpellier, Nice, Bordeaux and of course Paris, but have chosen Cannes to live. It is more expensive than Montpellier and perhaps Bordeaux, but not more than Nice or certainly Aix. Aix I found to be the most expensive after Paris.",

Actually, Aguascalientes is a City, we have a pretty great urbanization, also, at least the 50% of the population have a great proficiency in English (including me), must of us are bilingual. I do really thing must of the information that you have es bay far incorrect. Also, there are better places here in which you can work than the one that is suggested here.  Also, Aguascalientes is ranked in the very first top ten in terms of security (is really safety).  I pretty much suggest you to do a trustful and accurate review of Aguascalientes… My city.",

And after a while navigating the city which is literally a maze becomes quite old. Recommend to visit Murano by the way.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "I wanted to comment on the low 'walkability' score because this is completely inaccurate - I lived in Erlangen for 4-1/2 years and never owned a car. I walked a lot around town, and it was perfectly safe. There are even some pedestrian zones with no traffic. Erlangen should have a really high score in this category- it's not exactly a big town where getting around on foot just isn't reasonable. You can alternatively ride a bike pretty much anywhere. Getting in and around town is also possible with public transport - trains and buses which are reliable, affordable, and convenient.  Also, it was super easy to make friends... if you make an effort. If you walk around being very loud and drawing attention to yourself, locals will shy away from you. Once you make an effort to meet locals, there is plenty to do. It's not a touristy town so it's easy to miss all the fun that's available. If you happen to be in Erlangen during the annual Bergfest (the 3rd largest beer festival in all of Germany), you're in for a real treat. The only real downside is the weather - it does get really cold, and stay cold for too long.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Cardiff is a lovely and friendly place filled with plenty of shopping areas, plenty of cuisines all over the city whatever your pallet may be and is not too expensive shall you go to the right places, my favourites being YO! sushi which I loved to go with my partner (the furukaki fries now named yo fries are to die for) but while here there are a lot of things you must do; buy welsh cakes and get yourself a coffee or tea they are delicious little flat cakes sold all over the city for cheap usually cheaper in bulk. I saw 10 for 3 pounds in many flavours, raisins, chocolate, cinnamon, lemon the list goes on. next you need to go to Cardiff castle (it can be pricey) during normal session it costs 13 pound a person but during popular events like football it is often free to visit and climb the castle which is what I did during a football game in the millennium stadium and yes it does get crowded when these games are on but the good thing being in the city the roads close so people can walk on the roads making it easier to not get stepped on. while here you need to try a nice pub at least one time while I cant remember the name there is a lovely cocktail bar/pub that does 2 for 1 cocktails for 7 pound (my favourite being buffalo soldier (which is rum, ginger beer and apple juice with lime added and its delicious). when you are here make sure you check out the welsh gift shops and get a few souvenirs here, the amount of highly detailed and shiny dragon statues you can buy are insane so if you like castles, medieval literature and dragons (and sheep) make sure you come to Cardiff for a break from London.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Lusaka is a bustling city full of surprises if you look. The downside is rent is on the pricey side than say what you would expect to pay in most places in SEA. You can find some low rental places but then you'd be putting yourself in an environment that's not particularly safe. I'd pick a neighbourhood like Kabulonga, Woodlands, Chilenje, Ibex Hill or Makeni. Getting around is easier if you have a car or find a reliable cabby. You can also use the local rideshare app called Ulendo Taxi, it works well and even has female drivers, which I think is great for solo female travellers. Public safety is okay, best not to travel to compounds where safety can be a major issue, especially if you're a muzungu, a local word for 'White person' or someone considered well-off. Expect to be crowded around by street vendors selling everything from phone accessories, clothing, and sometimes local crafts. I wouldn't advise purchasing from these as you'll get ripped off - best go to the weekend markets or the craft village.  Zambia doesn't have a café or coffee culture per se but you can find some pretty decent coffee shops that have great coffee and free wifi. Zam Bean Coffee, The Corner Café and 3Tree's are my favs. I'd advise to join the Expat Group's on Facebook for more tips and questions. ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "This island is wonderful !  I was there for a month and I fell in love with Curaçao.  Just to rectify : The tap water is incredibly good to drink !!  Anywhere you go you can drink tap water, even once I was in Daaibooi Beach which is 30 km away from the main city and I asked the guy at the snack bar to fill my bottle and the water was as nice as downtown !! Amazing !!   If you are a bike rider (bicycle), forget it !  You will get killed, there is no shoulder, neither sidewalks.  Some roads looks like Beyrouth at a certain era, but in general they are ok.  Stray dogs are everywhere.  Every family ther has at least 2 dogs, and at night, you sometimes feel like Kevin Costner in Dances with wolves with all the dogs barking at the moon.  Nothing grows there, but cactus do!!  I crashed my drone in the 'forest' and I worked very hard to bring it back !   And I agree, if you are not a freak like I am, you will need a car.",

One of the cheapest cities to live in CA, great lifestyle with Sac river, hiking, fishing, outdoor activities, one hour from Lassen National Park, one hour from Mt Shasta. And still only a three hour drive from the Bay Area for meetings etc. Growing business/startup scene too. Lots of young people with a number of schools bringing internationals through every year. Definitely worth checking out. ",

All hotels have Wi-Fi and even though not always great, generally it's good enough.  Like I said, Pakistani people are incredible and the food is super super cheap. You'll have a hard time spending more than 10$ in a day. Next to that, you're gonna be the only foreigner in Lahore, even though it's such a big city. Most people have never seen a foreigner and are very happy to be your friend.   They'll never ask anything of you and actually, will want to pay EVERYTHING for you. Your drinks, your food... no way a Pakistani is gonna let you pay.   Lahore is an amazing town with lots to discover and an amazing culture.  The downsides are the heavy pollution, not only the air, but also the trash people leave on the streets. Cars keep honking at each other for fun, including noise pollution. If you can get over that, it's an amazing place to stay for a week to a few weeks.",

However, as a female traveler, I encountered situations that made me feel unsafe. The nature of unwanted attention I received was unsettling, and differed from my experiences in Dubai.  This feeling of unease was further amplified by witnessing several public arguments escalate quickly, even over seemingly trivial matters. One particularly disturbing incident involved two men who went from arguing to one punching the other, knocking him unconscious. It's important to acknowledge that travel experiences are subjective, and I encourage others to research Doha's diverse neighborhoods to determine if it aligns with their comfort level and travel style.",

What I love about this city is its beauty, walk ability and convenience to other places such as Germany, Switzerland and other parts of France, just to name a few.  It’s a big, little city.  It has an airport as well, for when you want to go further.  The cost for groceries were not any different than other parts of France or Germany.  There are many students here and a rich culture of Alsatian, German and French cultures interwoven.  The orange park is a fantastic place to walk, relax and picnic.  Getting around on the tram and bus is very easy.  City center is highly touristy, so if you don’t want that, I advise staying a little further out of the area.  ",

It's a small island, so expect to start bumping into people you know after a couple of days, but it's got enough to offer to keep you entertained for a couple of weeks, and if you kitesurf even longer.   There are some apartment with internet speed allowing you to work from there, and two coworking spaces if that's what you prefer.   One thing to keep in mind is that the prices in Boracay are not as low as in other countries in Asia. Good lunch can cost you anywhere from 8-10 euros up.",

The things that have improved since then: Internet is faster, cheaper as of June 2023, more grocery stores with imported goods although supplies don't last very long, police don't harass expats as much when driving on the road. The bad, crime is worse and seasonal, poor harvest means more break-ins and thefts, corruption in all places is rampant, and poverty is everywhere.",

However, the city itself is chaotic, dirty, no traffic rules, I felt more like in SE Asia than in Western Europe. There is not much going on in the city, you can walk the main stuff in half a day. I do not recommend to stay here short term, definitely not long term. Use the airport and then go to some charming village which there are plenty in this part of Italy.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Although I would not praise Cologne as the top destination for digital nomads I have certain doubts about some negative aspects listed here.   Hospitals: How can hospitals be pretty bad if Germany has one of the best medical systems in the world? This judgments compares it with remote 3rd world cities which is by definition not logical. Germany, and therefore also Cologne, has most likely the best emergency system in the world (ambulance must arrive within max. 12 minutes - independent of traffic) and no one will ask \"who pays\" when you have a serious illness/accident. Doctors have a high education as well (you have to be part of the top 5% of high school to enter a medical study).  Cold in winter: Well, it is not a tropical country. However, snow is rarely. Temperature during days drops below zero on maximum 20 days a year. Surely it is not the most sunny place on earth, but \"very cold\" is definitely elsewhere.  Friends: Cologne is the city of carnival. From November to February you will find parties every day and meet people. Surely, friends are made elsewhere, but at least you will not be alone drinking your Kölsch at the bar. \"Bar talks\" with strangers are common. Share your number and see what happens. Besides this, Cologne has a tradition of clubs (football club, tennis club, carnival club...). If you want to find friends, you must integrate and do such things as well. Then you find plenty of cool people. Just break the ice.",

We stayed in a beautiful 3-bedroom, 2 bath house in the Phakalane neighborhood.  I felt safe and secure.  The weather in early February was beautiful, although it did rain some.   If you're looking for excitement and a lot of activities, Botswana may not be for you but I loved it.  I thought the quality of life in Gaborone was perfect.",

The beach is fantastic, grocery stores are a couple mins walk from nearly everywhere you could be in the city, wifi is good and the train access to Menton, Eze, etc. or quick drive to provence makes getting around to explore the region super easy.   The only things I learned from my time and would think about next time: - if you go in May, you will wish you had air conditioning because it gets pretty hot in the evenings and the city is lively, so you'll hear all of the happenings if you're relying on open windows, and you'll wake up with lots of mosquito bites - Bed bugs were a thing more than I would have expected - I had a friend visit and get them from their airbnb, and two other friends who also got bed bugs from their spot, so keep an eye out.

    "descriptionFromReview": "I lived for 2.5 months in Kumbo, hours outside of Doula, in summer (their winter) 2009, doing feminist humanitarian aid work. If I could go back in time, I never would have gone as I developed chronic fatigue syndrome for 4.5 years starting during this trip, due to overvaccinating (several tropical diseases injected into me in a short time), the Malarone effects, poor diet, stress, etc. I stopped by Doula for a one night stay both when I arrived and when I left. Do not give men at the airport money. Don't let anyone handle your suitcases. Guys came out wearing (fake) uniforms, then repeatedly demanded money from me. I eventually told them in French to \"leave me alone,\" which worked, but the cab drivers took my luggage even though I told them I was waiting for the hotel to pick me up (hotels should do this, I used Ibis and it was very clean and comfortable, with hot water). The woman working at Ibis told me not to go outside at all, even during the day. (I was traveling alone.) An activist I met in Kumbo said they knew someone who was robbed at knife point at 11 a.m. in Doula. I had black stuff coming out of my nose after the bus ride through town from the pollution being so bad. The airport demanded more money when I returned, and I honestly couldn't tell if it was legit, the guy kept insisting and they even had a booth. Living in Kumbo, I was one of only about 10 white people I saw the entire time I was in Cameroon. It took three days to travel between there and Doula. I felt much more comfortable in the small town, but was often lectured by older men about not greeting properly (once said \"hey\" to my friend and he berated me for being so casual until I started crying). I had stomach spasms from eating and developed a rash from the dirty water (though there are clean water sources, I just chose to use the shower instead of a bucket). I spoke French in Doula and English in the Northwest region, I'm not sure if many people speak English in Doula or not. I met people who'd gotten malaria while staying in Cameroon, and people waited to take malaria pills till after they got sick, since it's the same pill (which is what I'd do in hindsight). Overall, it was the most culture shock I've ever had and a very challenging experience. As far as I know, people only traveled there to help social causes like I was (the Peacecorps has a presence), not for tourism. I'm not sure how it is now, but in 2009, I had to go to a (pretty slow) internet cafe, didn't have internet at home (though I believe they had it in the Doula Ibis hotel), and there were days-long electricity outages. So I don't know that it would make sense for a digital nomad long term.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Dayton is a growing city. Many parts of Dayton-proper are still experiencing severe poverty but a few area are beginning to see gentrification. The area has moved away from the large-scale industry which has all but abandoned the area and now experiences a lot of growth through local entrepreneurs including a rich culture of Craft Beer brewing, tattoo shops, cafes, music, and a variety of other \"fun\" businesses. While Dayton, itself, is growing fast and the housing prices can be extremely cheap, one will find that the surrounding suburbs host a large portion of the local population and are not lacking in entertainment or cultural life. The metroparks are outstanding and bike trails are rapidly tying various areas together. Technology-wise, the area has two universities and a large Air Force base so one would find mostly enterprise-level organizations. There is a lot of potential to grow the local technology scene and Dayton hosts one of the largest HAM Radio festival annually.",

The city is bike friendly and foreign friendly, much better than the east and the south part of Finland. The city is promoting startups and improving environment toward internationalisation, so the future is bright and worthy.  There is not much nightlife activities to do besides drinking and dancing, but in the summer you can do sports as it is never dark. I love the pier and city library, and this is the most famous area in Oulu where you can find many interesting events like the Polar Bear Pitch, Farmer's Market, MegaMatching, etc. Besides being called the Silicon Valley of Finland, Oulu is also a heaven to outdoor lovers with many trail paths as well as their campfires and saunas along the rivers and lakes.  To me Oulu is perfect for Nomads who are up to challenges.",

Very few cafés/restaurants/bars/museums/etc. Therefore it'll also be hard to make friends and connections. As with the rest of Norway, it's very expensive. The public transport is limited. The pros: Art Noveau architecture and lots of green areas, generally very safe city regardless of neighborhood. I'd recommend stopping by for a few days (a week tops) if you're in Norway anyway, but I would not recommend moving here for an extended period of time. (BTW: if you're in Ålesund, plan a day trip to Geiranger – the drive there takes a few hours and is well worth it!) ",

Being concrete: 1) In cafés you are expected to order, drink the coffee and get out, not to chill for half day 2) People will not speak English even if they knew, they still answer in Italian 3) You can't go swimming or gyming without a doctor's certificate that you're eligible for that activity.... you may buy cigarretes without doctor's appointment though :-/ 4) Renting houses / cars  is expensive, especially in summer 5) You are not allowed to sleep at the beaches nor to camp anywhere else except tha camping paid places 6) Even McDonalds wifi won't work without linking with your social network account ",

Tulum Pueblo is ugly, noisy, and full of development. A boom town where everyone seems out to fleece the gringo. It's also an ecological disaster. Watch the Dark Side of Tulum. And think twice before swimming in some of the local cenotes: they're full of E Coli.  The public beach in winter was nice. But this is a shitty place to work from, unless you want to drop a lot of money, and even then, it's a party atmosphere.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Graz is a nice place. It's prettiest in the Innere Stadt, like the old city center. So probably stay there. Graz has a very lefty, alternative, hippe vibe to it. You'll see people wear lots of hemp and earth toned clothing and dreadlocks all over the place. Which is kinda fun for a change. The same people you'd see in Ubud or Koh Pha Ngan or Goa, you'll see in Graz. Speaking of the people, they're nice, but they won't smile at you in public mostly. I also wouldn't say it's easy to meet people here, but that's probably Austrian culture. Everyone already got their cliques.  Oh one annoying thing, eveeeeeryone smokes here or that's how it feels like. You won't be able to sit anywhere outside without getting smoke in your face.  In terms of activities, you can do quite a lot of hiking/walking around Graz in the hills and mountains. It's really beautiful if you just walk half an hour north east which we did.  A nice place to work is Martin Auer, they have a few diff spots around town, really AMAZING coffee and baguette sandwhiches there, you won't believe how good. Also the Kunsthaus Graz has a great cafe with amazing food.  So TL;DR Graz is a nice little cosy town, fun to stop by for a few days.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Bocas del Toro is an awesome place to come and work at. There are different places to stay and work in Bocas del Toro, throughout the archipelago that offer different experiences. Some places are more remote with high speed internet service, comfortable settings just a bit far so getting into town and enjoying the nightlife can be more difficult. If you want to stay in town there are some options in Bocas Town with co-working spaces like Selinas Hostel, but keep in mind there is a lively nightlife there, so this is great for meeting people but maybe not the best for a quiet night. Some places out of town are Saigon Bay just a few minutes outside of of the center of town. There you can find some quiet bed and breakfasts offering longer term rental options as well as vacation rentals and Airbnbs. Some nice options over Saigon Bay include: Over Water Rentals, Saigon Bay Bed & Breakfast and Barrbara Bed and Breakfast. Further out towards Bluff Beach there are some super cute options like Somewhere or Nowhere, as well as Nomad Tree Lodge, Hummingbird Bed and Breakfast as well as other super cute Airbnbs, keep in mind the further out you are, the higher the chances of having bad internet connection are. Make sure to ask about their internet provider, there are some really good ones that work even in remote areas of Bocas.  Lots of restaurants and cafes offer comfortable places to work as well with great internet and excellent dishes and coffees. Try places such as Cafe del Mar, Super Gourmet, and Buena Vista Restaurante.  Nightlife and activities are abundant. You will never be bored in Bocas del Toro. After working, enjoy activities such as surfing, bike riding, explore the beaches and reefs, for paddling, go sailing, etc. You can also learn Spanish, look for Habla Ya Spanish Schools they have some great longer term programs.   Bocas del Toro is a great spot for digital nomads, you should definitely check this place out!",

This is a surfers' paradise year around, weather is good to fantastic throughout the year, life is peaceful and healthy. This is also a golfer's paradise with 16 courses around the city. Many biking roads start in Biarritz and wind up into Pyrenees. There is always plenty to do here, and international festivals abound, so do surfing and swimming competitions. How about helicopter tour or airplane free fall? Salt water swimming pool. Miles of fabulous sandy beaches and dunes. We have wonderful farmer's markets, luxury clothing stores, local creators, theater with very high quality ballet troupe, opera directly from the METH, wonderful food, nightclubs, museums... Prices are very reasonable for France, and almost everybody speaks English, French and Spanish. You can live on shabby-chic or extreme luxury, what every your budget allows. High speed internet, city wide Wi-Fi coverage. People are very friendly, both locals and transplanted ones. Oh yeah, just 25km from San Sebastian in Spain. International airport with direct flights to many European capitals, train to Bordeaux and Paris in a few hours... I can't imagine better place to live and work - except maybe Kauai island. ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "I like Baoding and think it is an underrated city in China. I have stayed there visiting in-laws for a few weeks at a time. While, unlike Beijing, you will probably never encounter a single English speaker, you can experience a very similar lifestyle as Beijing at a fraction of the cost. Baoding has a great shopping mall (Wanbo Square) that has any kind of food you could want. Realistically, you could stay in a great hotel for somewhat cheap for a couple months at a time. You could also choose to stay in an AirBnb as many of the apartments are relatively new and clean on the inside-- but as with all individual lodgings, as with all private residences in China, as a foreigner you MUST register with the local police within a day of arrival. I've never experienced any trouble with Baoding law enforcement while registering. If you want to experience unique parts of Beijing, traveling over to Beijing is extremely cheap-- less than $10 USD for the high speed rail.   tldr: comparatively inexpensive and good quality life, some grasp of Chinese is a must, follow local laws.

One thing worth noting is that the air quality can be quite bad, and the drivers are also quite erratic. Probably wouldn't live in Turin long-term, but it's worth a visit for sure. ",

Sure, it's expensive (probably around 80-90% of Bay Area cost of living), but the weather is perfect (not too hot, not too cold, all year around), the scenery is beautiful (mountains on one side, ocean on the other), and the city itself is fairly old and cozy (home to the second oldest building in California). People are generally friendly and laid back, lots of tourists, plenty of hipsters. Lots of rich people and celebs own houses here. There's UCSB, a top-50 ranked university, which can provide both intellectual stimulation and fun (concerts, lectures, and partying in student town of Isla Vista). Los Angeles is ~2 hours away, San Jose ~5 hours away. ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Was really looking forward to Hua Hin after everything we had read. On the plus side, everything is very accessible and of course loads of high quality Thai food everywhere, mixed in with a bunch of expat options.  Found the western-style markets and prices in general to be considerably more (in relative terms) than Bangkok. I imagine this is due to the large expat community here. Having said that, Covid has decimated the place and many expats have left. As an example, it’s Friday evening here right now (July ‘22) and both Tamarind and Cicada markets are virtually empty.  On the down side, at least for me, there’s really not that much to do here. Particularly if you want to be somewhere where there are great beaches, at least by Australian, Caribbean or Southern Thailand standards, then think again. If you are ok with brown sand and no surf to speak of then you’ll probably like it. ",

It is the safest for female travellers, the police detains every man that verbally or fiscally abuses a woman. Prices go from 20€ a night to over 200€, that is why there are real successful digital nomads here, no \"Tramps\" with laptops. If you avoid the city centre and Puerto Banus but go to Elviria you have a perfect quiet workplace.  Now there is a brand new flat bicycle path all along the beach from Capobino, Elviria, Center  8km to Puerto Banus but a car or a E-Bike is a plus as Andalucía is mountainous. ",

Think that  Italy is the only country in the world where each region produce a different kind of wine with different kind of local grapes. It is a real bless for palate. Italians are friendly and locals even more. Almost everybody speaks English here. I am a women and I consider the place to be  a Women safe place. Moreover, Firenze and Tuscany are LGBTQ+ friendly: just remember that the first worldwide  riot aimed to fight in  favor of  the Gay Community happened in Florence almost 500 years ago with the Medici's!  As most part of Europe, Winter is cool and windy but Spring, Summer and Fall are the best period ever! During the Pandemic, the Tuscan hospitals have demostrated to be over the top of their expectations  to face  both the emergency and   the daily care. In Italy, health care at  hospital  is FREE  for everybody,  foreigners included. Just to recap: food and wine are simply amazing and born to satisfy all palates in particular also veggie and vegan, art  and  nature are all around you, the region is really  safe, nightlife is cool, so I think  it is high time to pack your bags! I really recommend it. Just Enjoy Firenze which is also a great place for a workaction away from your home and your office! Moreover,   traveling  with your pet is easy as they are very welcomed almost all over and vets are fab!",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Brighton has some obvious positives.   It has a beach, it's one hour from London and the UK's 2 biggest airports. It's one of the few UK places outside of London which has a considerable cultural/creative scene.  Unfortunately, the city has a massive problem with street-sleeping, begging and drugs (Many street people from the rest of the UK relocate to Brighton).  It's difficult to spend an hour walking through the town centre without being harassed. In my 6 months living there, my apartment (in a 'posh'  area) was broken into twice at night.  The city is expensive. Affordable if you are on a London salary & commuting - otherwise it's not worth it. For nomads, I'd recommend looking further along the South coast for a better cost of living.",

On the positive side, the city provides affordable accommodation options and a decent food scene with noteworthy restaurants like Celele or bars like Alquimico. The city's nightlife boasts lively bars and rooftop venues, and the sunsets are truly beautiful.  However, prostitution and sex tourism is really to much and to present, which may be uncomfortable for some visitors... Safety can be a concern depending on where you stay (locals advised me not to walk alone at night). The city is really noisy, and full of scams.  A short trip there can have it's charms if you stay in the Centro or Boca Grande or Castillo Grande. If you look for protitutes, it's like open bar. Overwise I think this place is a bit overrate for the DNs lifestyle.",

Pretty much any apartment has at least a 100 Mbps connection and a big portion already have upwards of 300 Mbps both download and upload. Some even have a 1 Gbps connection. If you only judge by the speed you get at cafes, then obviously you won't get a fast internet since the available bandwidth is split between everyone who's connected at that time, but that's a very poor way of judging it.  My 4G connection itself gets around 85 Mbps, which is way higher than what you get in most other countries from a broadband connection!",

There is a really nice river embankment in the city where you can walk around or run. Take in mind that almost all the shops are completely closed on Sundays, which is still very unusual to me. Augustiner bräu is a really atmospheric bar which can recommend to visit, and Hangar-7 museum from Red Bull which is free to check out is also quite nice.",

There are also some great spas & thermal baths. In the past years, a lot of rich DNs moved there from Spain to establish residence and take advantage of the tax breaks. It's a bit on the expensive side, I'd recommend it if you want to escape Barcelona for a few days. In COVID times, there were almost no cases or restrictions.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Been to Aarhus many times and always enjoy coming here. The people are incredibly friendly, and I personally would change the Friendly to Foreigners rating to “Great”. There are also a lot of cosy cafes and bakeries, which are nice to hang around in when the rain and wind show their faces — as they often do.   The city has a good range of things to keep you interested, and the nature nearby is also pleasant. Definitely go to ARoS when you visit; the panoramic view is cool, but the exhibitions were also interesting when I went.   The city is expensive, but Denmark is a pricey country in general. I would recommend staying in either Aarhus Ø or Frederiksbjerg if you could choose any neighbourhood, though those are also the most desirable ones so the competition for places is high haha.   I personally don’t mind the weather so much, but that would be a negative for a lot of people. Ditto for cost of living. The only thing that would stop me moving here is that Aalborg and Copenhagen have better airport connections IMO. ",

The city doesn't hold any world-famous monument as it could be Pisa's tower, but has one of the oldest universities in the world (with much of it converted to a museum), is home to the best and well known meals (lasagna, mortadella, tortellini, just to mention few), is home to so many famous people that I cannot even count, has the headquarters of the gay association (with one of the nicest night clubs in the city), there are almost 16000 students at the university, 10% of which are foreigners, and the rest you can google it. In the Pros and Cons someone said \"not much to do\": they are clearly living in another dimension, because Bologna is literally THE CITY of entertainment. Also, I don't know how they came up with almost 5000$/month to live... If you don't aim for luxury, with 1000€ you can live a cheap but fair life: with 2000$ you can live a nice and happy life, going out every other day. In few words: to the hell the data about the cities on this website, it's all bs.",

Biggest downside is it's hard to get around without a car, and you really will want access to one here so you can visit the mountains or the ocean beaches, or the big city of Boston - any of which are easily possible to do for the day from here (all less than 2 hours' drive). New Hampshire is an incredible state if you want to experience nature. Not a lot to do within the city itself. Excellent internet service. Very cold in the winter. West side has a large French Canadian population. I wouldn't go here unless you are traveling with your car or are willing to rent one from time to time to enjoy the surrounding natural attractions.",

I have done about 2.5 months total in PV (two separate trips). Airbnbs are plentiful near the centro and december 5, more expensive in the romantic zone and even more expensive in Sayulita. But central PV is pretty cheap, even inland from Hotel Zone is nice and cheap. Roads and walkways are narrow and horrible. Internet is OK. If you stay in PV central, the beach isn't so great for swimming, it's rocky and dirty. The nightlife is mostly in Sayulita with a little bit also in Romantic zone, not much else. The noise, the traffic, music, and construction of many streets are LOUD. It is a loud place most of the time. Also, unlike CDMX, many places will not take credit card.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "I don’t know why Costa Rican cities aren’t ranked higher on this list. Puerto Viejo is an amazing fun little town with a lot to do. I took a bus ride here from Bocas Del Toro, Panama after spending time there and I really enjoyed it.   It’s great because it’s like a mix of Carribean and Latin American vibes. There are so many outdoor activities to do here. there‘a Cahuita national park if you want to go hiking and see a lot of cool animals, there’s beach volleyball everyday at playa cocles, the black sand beach at playa negra is beautiful, Punta Uva has some stunning views. It also has the best food in Costa Rica since the food is more Jamaican inspired. Every evening there’s usually something going on somewhere whether it’s salsa night, reggaeton night, carribean music night, or an EDM DJ playing. The most popular places for nightlife have their outdoor area right on the beach is also really cool. I was initially worried about getting reliable Wi-Fi but it actually turned out to work fine at my airbnb and most cafe/lunch spots. There aren’t really coworking spaces though.  The main cons I see is that it’s still Costa Rica so it is pricier than other nearby countries. Also the tech & medical infrastructure is not the best and it’s kind of far from any major cities so if you get sick/injured or need to buy some tech merchandise it will cause some difficulty. Last if you’re looking for a digital nomad community to do some networking you’re not going to find that here.  Overall I give it a 6.5/10 for nomading and an 8/10 for vacation.",

The coworking space there isn't good, but the coffee inside the same \"building\" is very cool. I would recommend you to stay here 3 or 4 days, after that it's a bit boring. It's quiet in the week day, so better you manage to schedule to be there at least one friday or saturday, if you like partying.",

Much quieter with elements of the old medina but scaled down and arguably prettier. You're not pestered like you might be in Marrakech too. I visited everything there is to visit within a day so it really is a place to relax and mellow out. Prices are a bit more reasonable when it comes to Morocco and the weather is nice (but constantly windy). Wouldn't recommend to anyone wanting an adrenaline rush (unless water sports are your thing) although alcohol and beach bars are plentiful!",

It’s a fantastic place to stay for one week max! Also, there are A LOT of old, wealthy gringo retirees here that were once hippies, so a lot of organic and vegan options are here. It’s in the low 80’s each day and sunny.  Once the sun sets, the temp drops and feels amazing outside.  Long sleeves or light jacket is plenty.    Pros: -beautiful surroundings just walking around  -walkable as long as you don’t have limitations -a lot of cute hidden gems within the buildings -outside the city center there are options for horseback riding and hiking - Feels safe Cons (city center): - not a lot to do other than shop and eat  - Overrun by tourists on the weekends  - Church bells ring every 15 minutes (not exaggerating) all day and night - Random firecrackers and fireworks in the middle of the night - More expensive than CDMX ",

The most friendly people, great food, beautiful beaches and for a few weeks.. fun nightclubs.   All without the normal crush of tourists that would otherwise clog the place up.  Made some lifelong friends on this trip and cannot wait to get myself back to Hvar in 2021.  And other than the time difference (stayed on NYC time), I had no issues working remotely from the island whatsoever.  For the most part, I tethered from a local sim and was able to keep up video calls throughout the day...usually from a hammock somewhere on the island.  Hvar in 2020 really was paradise island. 10/10 recommend.",

That means that a digital nomad can be deported on a misunderstanding, because the police in Pattaya is not so used to deal with a digital nomads like they are in Phuket, Koh Samui and Chiang Mai, they put you in the same basket as illegally working Russians and out with you. Apart from that i would say that Pattaya is the part place for males aged 50+ so if you are a female or under 40, i would say Pattaya isn't for you. But ig you are a male 50+, then welcome to paradise! ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Just spent almost two weeks here after a two week stay in SMA.  This is a very pretty town, but 2 weeks is too long (3 days max if you just want to vacation).  There are many many steps and hills, so walking is the best way to get around.  I felt safe in the tourist areas, but with many narrow passageways, be careful if you are alone.  There is a lot of dogs barking at all hours that echo due to this area being a valley.  There is very little green space.  Also, not sure if there was some recent protests, but we saw a lot of graffiti on historical sites and the staff works every day to scrub it off.   I’m ok with protesting, but to vandalize historical builds is just sad.  One positive, accommodations are cheaper than SMA and CDMX, however, food is more expensive than CDMX.  Btw, the mummy museum, it’s more of a spectacle that is kinda sad and disrespectful, in my opinion.  It could have been much better had it been educational.  Finally, don’t be alarmed if you hear random cannon-like fires as they are just ritual procedures.  It sounds like an invasion and it is mixed in with fireworks and firecrackers.  They happen randomly at random times and days.  ",

I felt particularly unsafe at gas stations and, as a woman, would not stop for gas by myself in Tallahassee.  I loved the Tallahassee Nature Museum, which I did feel safe visiting by myself.  They also have ziplining there, which was a dream - up above the cypress swamp!  I loved the fact that there were so many nature parks, bird sanctuaries and places to go canoeing and kayaking within an easy drive of this city.  FSU has an outstanding law school, but the university is located in an area that is particularly unsafe.  I also noticed a definite \"redneck\" presence in other areas of the city.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "My first city in Saudi Arabia! Spent a week there and actually had quite an interesting time. Old Jeddah in the center is extremely cool neighbourhood to walk around during evening, a lot of people around, sounds, lights all around, really liked the vibe.  People are really friendly in my opinion, was given some food treats by random Saudi family nearby in some cafe in the center, have never had an experience like that in many countries I've been to. Although I didn't really speak too much with locals apart from taxi driver and hotel worker. City is not very walkable, mostly very car oriented. Can recommend to have a walk on Corniche as well. What I didn't like - I just couldn't find any grocery shop which is not small place owned by Indian with shitty low-quality food, more like rice, ramens and snacks. So basically I had to go out to eat all the time.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Born and raised 1 hour from Daytona Beach. Pros - Beach is nice. The sand is so packed down you and bike up the beach. You can drive onto the beach and snag wifi from local hotels work in your van. There are a few decent coffee shops. Some nice Diners and local farmers markets depending on the day. If you have a paddle board or kayak there are plenty of players to pop it in the river or sea. The Cons: Unless you're into Nascar and Motorcycles there isn't too much to do after the sun goes down other than a local bar. For longer stays it can get a little quiet and slow. I look forward to if / when this area shifts into more of an entrepreneur vibe. ",

It's a fantastic little town - there are lots of tourists but there are many local joints and great spots with less people if you're willing to get out of the town square. Everyone is super friendly and it's easy to meet people here. There are a few good spots to co-work and the internet has been fine (not the best but more than usable for remote work i.e. software engineer). There's a good spot for surfing as a beginner, then there are the more crowded spots if you're a good surfer.",

I looked at it on google maps and saw it was really small and thought it was boring so I booked a 3 day trip here. Oh my how wrong was I?! 3 days was not enough to do what’s here at all. I went skiing, checked out the town center and so much more! I was so hooked with this place and did not want to leave! I sadly had to. I am in love with this place and will definitely be coming back in August next year!",

Any other time of the year, you can find a decent apartment for a decent price (~€800/mo) and take advantage of low cost of living. Has plenty of hikes around, ideal if you have a vehicle. Bicycle culture is pretty established, but not a lot of bike lanes sadly. Sun & Co is focal point of nomad community, but there are plenty of slowmads or ex-nomads who have settled here, so large international community.",

It's well connected via train, bus, and ferry boat, which makes it so easy to get around to anywhere in the country. Extremely clean. Almost everyone speaks English. Lots of young people in this area who visited once and then came back to live because they loved it so much. If you make it to Interlaken, make sure you go into Lauterbrunnen for the most stunning views and villages.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "I spent a week in Annecy several years ago and found it to be a beautiful small city.  The architecture is bright and cheerful and I love that water is all around.  Lake Annecy is very clean and I didn't see litter anywhere.  The train runs right into town, making it very easily accessible; the train station is walking distance to the car rental office.  I loved the old section of town and being able to walk everywhere.  I was surprised to see Annecy received a low rating for being family-friendly.  I saw lots of families engaged in fun activities, and puppeteers putting on shows for children.  When I took a boat tour on the lake, I saw young children and teens enjoying a swim; in town, I saw children of all ages riding their bicycles around.  Annecy is in good proximity to Chamonix and the French Alps.  The countryside is very scenic and the Gorges du Fier is beautiful.  For the most part, I wouldn't say the people were that friendly.  However, I made friends with a woman who lived upstairs from the VRBO I rented.  We still Skype to this day, but I have noticed that she often has difficulty with her internet connection.  I really enjoyed visiting Annecy and hope to return again soon.",

I'd just go straight to Laung Prabang if you want to see more of Laos. Or Vang Vieng if you want to party.   Vientiane wasn't very remote worker suitable either, just like entire Laos. Internet is slow and if it's not slow it's unstable and cuts out. Food ingredient quality seems very low but you pay the same price as in Thailand for worse.  Laotian people are REALLY friendly though and their English is much much better than Thai people.",

While I'm used to free/cheap wifi, friendly people, and great food living in place like Thailand, even staying in the most modern area in the country lacks all of those (no free Wifi even at Starbucks, and I've seen \"cooked fresh\" restaurant food taken out of the freezer before cooking). Social culture is very uncanny valley, people are \"polite\" but it's extremely fake, which you'll notice in subtle ways like slow service, not saying \"you're welcome\" to \"thank you,\" and just a general dispassionate disposition even if you're very polite (which I am). I've also gone on a few dates here, and each one has been in a constant competition for the most awkward thing I've ever experienced (and I've gone out with people all over the world). It's also very dangerous by Asia standards — you have to stay in your bubble to stay safe. My verdict is avoid, unless it's visiting their beaches for a few days.",

You cannot easily find things you need so bring all your necessities to start with. I have barely seen a street light, the traffic can be unbelievable. It's the perfect place for a real cultural experience and to learn wolof and French. You almost have no choice but to when here. Food made by the family I stayed with is great. So far I've only ate out once at a place in the city and I was not impressed.  Get all necessary vaccines before coming here and depending on where you are staying. From what I see this country is very much undeserved and they really deserve better than this, so don't expect to get vaccines readily available like living in other parts of the world. ",

Still, I consider it quite underdevelop. Internet connectivity was quite intermittent on the two places I stayed. Also, not many places to get work done! I always worked from my villa room. Highly suggest staying  by Nopparatthara beach rather than Ao Nang side. No many nomads in here aswell",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Great city if you want a quieter place, but close enough to São Paulo. If you live near the bus terminal, you can get a bus every 30 min to são paulo. It has some good coworking space if needed. Not as much to do as são paulo, but has some good food places, supermarkets, one good mall. If you live near the main avenue (nove de julho) and close to Jundiaí Shopping / bus terminal, it has some good apartaments to rent, close enough to a good supermarket, the mall, restaurants, public transportation, movie theater, etc. and is way cheaper than São Paulo. Just 1 hour by bus or 30 m in by car from São Paulo main avenues (Pinheiros or Marginal Tietê).",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Hello to everyone ! 🤟  I'm Seb Fourault , entrepreneur and digital nomad who has made Guadeloupe my place of life, as well as my entrepreneurial playground.  I want to share with you my experience and my discoveries on this magnificent island, which I see as a true paradise for all entrepreneurs and digital nomads from around the world.  Guadeloupe, with its idyllic climate, its rich culture and its strategic proximity to Europe and America, offers an exceptional living and working environment. Here, I found the perfect balance between work, leisure and discovery, in a stimulating and welcoming environment.  In this guide, I will tell you about everything you need to know to succeed as an entrepreneur or digital nomad in Guadeloupe: from the economic climate to available subsidies , including incubators , coworking spaces , and of course, the cultural and social aspects that make this island unique.  My objective ? Convince you that Guadeloupe is not just a holiday destination, but a real hub for entrepreneurs and digital nomads, comparable to places like Dubai, Bali or Thailand , with a unique French touch 🇫🇷  So, ready to dive into the Guadeloupean adventure? Follow me, and let's find out together how to make this island your next office paradise!  PS: This article is the fruit of my personal experience and information collected during my adventures in Guadeloupe, it is of course not an absolute truth and I do not claim that it covers all aspects. It will evolve as I discover, meet and receive your feedback. I hope it will be useful and inspiring to you! 😊  In the program : Guadeloupe, an Eden for Digital Entrepreneurs Understanding the Economic Climate in Guadeloupe Moving to Guadeloupe: Practical Aspects Subsidies and Support for Entrepreneurs Networks and Communities for Entrepreneurs in Guadeloupe Life in Guadeloupe: An Ideal Working Climate My Personal Tips on the Specificities of Guadeloupe  Guadeloupe, an Eden for Digital Entrepreneurs Guadeloupe is much more than a postcard of beaches and palm trees. It is a dynamic ecosystem, conducive to innovation and entrepreneurship. Let me tell you why this island is a top choice for digital entrepreneurs.  Climate and Environment: Imagine working with a view of the Caribbean Sea, surrounded by lush nature. Guadeloupe offers a pleasant tropical climate all year round, similar to Bali or Thailand, but with a major advantage: the stability and security of a French department.  Cultural Diversity and Strategic Proximity: Here you benefit from a unique blend of Caribbean and European cultures. Proximity to Europe and North America is a major advantage for business, especially with direct flights from the United States significantly reducing travel time.  An Innovation Hub: Guadeloupe is not left out in terms of technology and innovation. With local initiatives and support from the French government, the island is positioning itself as a growing technology hub.  In short, Guadeloupe offers an exceptional living environment, combined with a stimulating business environment. It is fertile ground for digital entrepreneurs looking to combine quality of life and professional opportunities.   Understanding the Economic Climate in Guadeloupe As an entrepreneur who took his first steps in Guadeloupe, I can assure you that the island's economy is as rich as its biodiversity. Here's a look at what you need to know about the local economic climate.  A Diversified Economy: Guadeloupe is not limited to tourism. Agriculture, renewable energy, and information technology are booming sectors. The Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Islands of Guadeloupe (CCI IG), among others, offers support to entrepreneurs.  Government Support: As a French department, Guadeloupe benefits from subsidies and support from the French state, particularly for new businesses and innovative projects. This includes financial aid as offered by BPI France , advice on business creation, and professional training.  A Dynamic Market on an advantageous Geographical location: The local population is receptive and demanding new technologies and innovations. Additionally, the island's geographic position provides easy access to American and European markets.  Time difference, an advantage? Most digital nomads who choose to emigrate to Asia complain that their clients in mainland France call on them until late in the evening, pushing them to work long days.  Here we are positioned in the other direction, we tend to get up a little earlier, which is not disturbing because the sun rises early, and from midday we are quiet and we can work without distraction because the metropolis has gone to bed (or go and enjoy the beach, your choice 😁).  Personally, I find it a real comfort for work/life balance and mental workload.  Challenges to Face: Like any region, Guadeloupe has its challenges, particularly in terms of logistics and infrastructure (water, ecology, energy, transport, access to care, etc.). However, these challenges also represent opportunities for resourceful entrepreneurs.  In summary, Guadeloupe offers a dynamic and diverse economic environment, with significant support for entrepreneurs. It’s fertile ground for those looking to innovate and grow in a tropical setting. To find out more: the CCI website .  Moving to Guadeloupe: Practical Aspects Moving to Guadeloupe as an entrepreneur or digital nomad requires good preparation. Here are some practical tips based on my personal experience and information gathered during my meetings.  Administrative Formalities: As a French department, Guadeloupe follows the same administrative rules as mainland France. For EU citizens, installation is relatively simple, especially for healthcare professionals. For others, a visa may be necessary. It is important to contact the nearest French embassy or consulate to find out the specific procedures.  Accommodation: Finding accommodation in Guadeloupe can be a challenge, especially during peak tourist season. Villa rentals are popular among expats and digital nomads.  The best is to favor local agencies like ZeWelcome rather than Airbnb or Booking , because you do not pay service fees and therefore you save between 15% and 20% on the price of your rental 👌  The districts of Gosier, Sainte-Anne , and Saint-François are very popular for their proximity to beaches and amenities. Furthermore, many companies are based in Jarry, which makes Gosier and Petit-Bourg attractive cities for their proximity to the workplace.  When we arrived with my girlfriend, we rented a villa for 1 month, just to discover the island and find out better where we wanted to settle.  Internet connection: Connectivity is essential for digital nomads. Guadeloupe offers good internet coverage, with fiber optic options in urban areas: Baie-Mahault, Les Abymes, Le Gosier, Le Moule, Sainte-Rose, Le Lamentin, Capesterre-Belle-Eau, Morne à l'Eau , Saint-Claude, Trois-Rivières, Guava, Gourbeyre, Vieux-Fort.  In more remote areas, you will have to make do with ADSL but I assure you it works quite well.  Transport: Having a car is almost essential in Guadeloupe to explore the island and go to professional meetings. Look on LeBonCoin or turn to professionals. Car rental is a convenient option, with many services available at the airport and in major cities.  Luggage and moving: If you plan to settle in for the long term, a viable option may be to bring your car from the mainland. You put all your luggage in it and you rent a container which is transported to Guadeloupe by boat.  In summary, settling in Guadeloupe requires a certain amount of organization, but once there, the quality of life and professional opportunities more than compensate for the initial efforts.  Networks and Communities for Entrepreneurs in Guadeloupe Guadeloupe offers a dynamic entrepreneurial ecosystem, but with a particularity: many circles of entrepreneurs operate privately 😬, which can represent a challenge for newcomers. Here are some concrete ways to integrate into these networks:  Private Groups and WhatsApp: Groups like “Entrepreneurs Solidaires”, initiated by Julien Amodeo of Tech in Caraibes ( LinkedIn ), or “Les amis du Spot” created by entrepreneur Jordan Succar ( LinkedIn ) are examples of these private circles. It is essential to actively solicit addition to these groups, often through LinkedIn or other professional contacts.  GuadeloupeTech: This association regularly organizes networking events and meetings around digital technology and entrepreneurship. It's a great way to meet other professionals and stay up to date with the latest trends.  ZeBox Events: The ZeBox community, with talented organizers like Camille Pourret and Fatoumata Issa-Alzouma ( Camille's LinkedIn , Fatoumata's LinkedIn ), frequently organizes entrepreneurship-related events. These events are golden opportunities to expand your network and gain inspiration from other entrepreneurs.  ZeBox Incubator Guadeloupe The ZeBox incubator in Guadeloupe Incubators: Le Village by CA Guadeloupe ( LinkedIn ) and ZeBox, the CMA-CGM incubator ( Website ), are key incubators offering valuable support to startups.  Coworking Spaces: In addition to ZeBox, which offers monthly packages for members of its network, other spaces such as Iresa, CoWinner, Le Fort Coworking Social Hub, and Level Up Pli Wô offer suitable and conducive working environments. to networking ( EWAG article ).  Integrating into the Guadeloupean entrepreneurial environment requires a proactive approach. It is crucial to be open, actively participate in local events and seek entry into these private groups to successfully integrate.  Life in Guadeloupe: An Ideal Working Climate Guadeloupe offers an exceptional living environment that combines work and pleasure. Here are concrete examples for each aspect of life on the island:  Tropical Climate: Imagine starting your work day with a view of the Caribbean Sea, a mild and sunny climate all year round. I am writing these words to you from my terrace at Le Gosier, with a light breeze which makes working outdoors pleasant even in the middle of the day 😊  Activities and Leisure: After a productive day, there is nothing like a hike in the Guadeloupe National Park, exploring the tropical forest and discovering hidden waterfalls. For diving enthusiasts, the waters around Pigeon Island offer spectacular dive sites, perfect for unwinding on the weekend.  Vibrant Community: Guadeloupean culture is rich and welcoming. I had the opportunity to participate in the Guadeloupe Carnival, a colorful festival that celebrates local culture with music, dance and traditional costumes. It's a great way to immerse yourself in the community and build connections. “Chanté Nwèl” are also a must at Christmas!  Accessibility: Guadeloupe is well served by direct flights from Paris, New York, and other major cities, this accessibility facilitates business travel. The Guadeloupe archipelago is surrounded by small islands where time stops for a weekend: Marie-Galante, Les Saintes, La Désirade.  It's also incredible to take a getaway to other Caribbean islands , such as Dominica (2 hours by boat), Martinique (4 hours by boat or 30 minutes by plane), or even catamaran cruises to Antigua -Barbuda, or Saint Vincent & The Grenadines 😎  A-detailed-and-accurate-illustrative-map-of-Guadeloupe-and-its-surrounding-islands-closely Safety and Quality of Life: Living in Guadeloupe also means benefiting from a safe environment and quality public services, with developed health infrastructures, and administrative services similar to those offered in mainland France (try to anticipate everything similarly, time passes differently here).  In summary, Guadeloupe is not only a place of business opportunities, it is a true paradise for those seeking to combine work and quality of life.  My Personal Tips on the Specificities of Guadeloupe Ah, Guadeloupe! A paradise for entrepreneurs, but with its little particularities 😅  👉 Here are my personal tips , with a touch of humor, for navigating this unique world:  1. Waze > Google Maps: Forget Google Maps for your journeys. Here, Waze is king! He knows every shortcut and avoids traffic jams better than a local.  2. Check Business Hours: If Google says a business is open, take it with a grain of salt. Online timetables? More mythical than real. A word of advice: call before you travel.  3. WhatsApp and Insta, the New Kings: SMS, LinkedIn, Facebook Messenger? It's from the past. Here, everything happens on WhatsApp or Instagram. Get ready to become a voicemail pro.  personal tips and peculiarities of life in Guadeloupe. 4. The Handshake, Key to Business: In Guadeloupe, business is done face to face, with a good handshake. Forget video calls to close a deal, here we rely on human contact.  5. Alternative Services: No Uber, Vinted or Amazon? Do not panic. This is the perfect opportunity to discover local alternatives or even launch your own business in a less saturated market.  👉 Local alternatives to known services:  Deliveroo → EasyTaVie / Please Uber → En Woute / Coco Veepee → Island Deal / Foodiles Le Bonbon → Travel Art Caribbean / Kkfèt Blablacar → Karos SeLoger → Domimmo / LeBonCoin Meetup → Instagram Le Bon Coin → The “Gwada Connexion” Facebook group Google → Ask your neighbor, they will probably know more than Google 😅 6. Speak Creole: Learn the expressions above all. It's cool, it shows your interest in local culture and it opens doors.  My favorite: “Sé grenn diri ka fé sak diri”, it’s the grain of rice that makes the bag of rice, which could be translated into “small streams make long rivers”.   7. Understand Local History: Visit the ACTe Memorial and pick up a book on the history of Guadeloupe. Understanding Guadeloupe's colonial and cultural past is essential to truly grasp the soul of the island and its people.  8. Import and Adapt Concepts: No need to reinvent the wheel. Many concepts don't exist here yet. Import an idea and adapt it to local specificities. For example, a well-designed manicure booking service could be a hit.  9. Experience the Local Rhythm: Listen to music and explore local dances (hello twerk and bouyon!).   10. Smart Phone Plan: Take a metropolitan plan from Sosh. Plenty of Gigas to work from anywhere, and above all much cheaper than local telephone offers.  11. Join the Gwada Connexion group: If you are looking for the beating heart of the online community in Guadeloupe, look no further than the “Gwada Connexion” Facebook group ( link to group ).  It’s a real melting pot of exchanges, information and local tips. Imagine a place where you can find everything: sales announcements, travel advice, lively debates, and even rants or job offers.  12. Immerse yourself in the World of Local Podcasts: To truly understand the entrepreneurial spirit in Guadeloupe, there is nothing like listening to the stories and experiences of local actors through podcasts.   Here are some suggestions:  “Digital Sauces”: This podcast ( website ) focuses on digital and innovation. It offers in-depth interviews with local entrepreneurs, sharing their journeys, successes and advice. “We are reinventing the world”: This podcast offers a fascinating overview of the innovative ideas and projects that are shaping the future of Guadeloupe. He is an inspiration to anyone looking to make a positive change. “Outside the Zone”: Here, you will discover entrepreneurs who dare to think outside the box. It’s perfect for understanding the unique challenges and opportunities of island entrepreneurship. 13. Find out about the next “CrazyMonkey” events : Organized by Jordan Succar , a multi-hat Guadeloupean entrepreneur who has a thousand ideas at the minute.  Some examples of formats that he regularly organizes:  The Débouya Conf : These round tables bring together talented entrepreneurs for rich and qualitative discussions. They offer a unique platform to explore various topics from different angles, enriched by dynamic exchanges with the public. The Debouya Sprint: Halfway between a design thinking workshop and practical training, these sessions are the ideal place to quickly develop your skills. In a few days, you can immerse yourself in various fields such as no-code or automation, guided by inspiring and experienced speakers and trainers. Co-living: Imagine spending a week in a luxurious villa, surrounded by other entrepreneurs and freelancers, local and international. These stays are a perfect combination of invigorating activities like surfing and yoga, productive work sessions and invaluable networking opportunities. There you go, with these tips, you are ready to conquer Guadeloupe, while having fun. Good adventure !  My conclusion In summary, Guadeloupe is much more than just a vacation destination. It’s a true haven for entrepreneurs and digital nomads .  With its dynamic economic climate, supports for entrepreneurship, an active business community and an idyllic living environment, the island offers a perfect environment for those looking to combine work and pleasure.

    "descriptionFromReview": "Spent 2 months in Kigali and criss-crossed the country from there as my base. Pros: friendly people in the city (not so much in the far North rural areas of Rwanda if you travel on your own near Virunga). Clean air. A few good restaurants. Safe in the city (Kigali), even at night. Amazing wildlife and scenery/landscapes if you get a place with a good view and some nature around. Government entities have their sh*t straight more than many other nations. Average internet. Stable power grid. Cons: dangerous near Virunga unless you go on a guided tour, water is unpotable and unsafe from the tap unless boiled even in Kigali, locals stare at you without interruption (not in a frightening way but it's uncomfortable), dangerous to navigate the traffic unless you're used to complete road chaos, slow/poor service in restaurants, everyone asks you for money even the children in rural villages where tourists don’t go, need a car/motorcycle to do anything (not a walkable city), very poor selection of anything in terms of shopping needs and expensive. There's a lot of potential here and I'd gladly come back overall, just watch your safety (health, road, and up North).",

Budva is the largest tourist city, so it feels more like a city compared to other places. Budva isn't for beaches, as it's overpacked, expensive, dirty and the water is unhealthy dirty (If you want to swim go to Sveti Nikola and the beach on the right of the ballerina statue - the only clean water places). Budva is known as a party place with loads of Serbians. Nightlife stops at 1am except nightclubs which are filled with smoke, music is mostly Serbian or a mix with Serbian, all places are pretty casual (no high end feel) and at night all the streets (even the furthest ones) are filled with party people. Locals and Serbians like to stick to tables and don't socialize with others.",

Men catcalling, touching, and groping are the norm. Moreover, it is not cheap at all compared to other countries in South/Southeast Asia. Especially when landlords tend to increase rental prices once they learn you're a good tenant. Locals may appear friendly, but the reality often differs. As a patriarchal society, instances of domestic violence against girlfriends and wives are unfortunately not uncommon. Additionally, certain tourism-related businesses, such as surf schools, may be controlled by gangs. After 5 months in the country, I can say: don't go.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "A city in the grip of a financial crisis (Feb 2023), plus other calamities, so requires a bit more effort to do stuff than many places. But IMO worth the effort. You have to carry cash around and lots of bills as worth 1/40th of what they were a few years ago. You can't really use cards anywhere, except dollar ATMs and some supermarkets.  Electricity mostly from generators, which have downtime a few hours a day. You need to check the daily hours of supply for the building before booking a place. 4G internet good 30+Mbps. Wired internet variable. Local SIM, I got a Touch Lebanon one with 20GB data for about $25/month. Pricier if you buy at the airport. Airport close to city centre. $10-15 taxi fare. Uber and Bolt work but you must assign payment as cash and it will be more than the app says, because of the high downward volatility of the LBP currency. Some classier cafes or restaurants will take USD notes but mostly you need LBP.  Heaps of culture and history. Heaps of street art. A heartful people who have suffered insanely but still keep going, shows you the power of the human spirit to survive and thrive.  I like the place and will be back in summer.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Everyone here walks day and night, so it never feels very unsafe.  Even women walk at night, even though the lighting is bad, and the infrastructure is poor.  Sidewalks are crumbling, there is much trash and it is a dilapidated industrial city.  The people seem pretty miserable, but they are friendly enough to foreigners and nice to Americans.  Like much of Ukraine, the dollar goes a long way here, so you can be pampered and eat well very cheap.  The 2 biggest problems are (1) there isn't much to do here, and (2) it is an awful 8 hr car ride or train ride from Kyiv, so the city is kind of isolated.  Much pollution also (think of Pittsburgh PA in the 60's) so the quality of life is poor.  Very few hotels, so you'll have to rent a flat on AirBNB for only 20 USD/Euro per night.  Many things are negotiable here and the motto is \"everything is possible in Ukraine\".",

    "descriptionFromReview": "This is my hometown and a city I lived in for around 20 years of my life. If you want a place with a climate much warmer that Moscow and lower prices - look no further. This town would be great for you. In terms of speaking the language - you need to know Russian at certain degree, otherwise it might a bit a hard for you to navigate in the city.  The main street of the city is Krasnaya street and you can take a bike and go through the whole street and enjoy the beauty and the peace of the city. In terms of natural beauty, go to parks like Solnechniy ostrov, Dendrarium, Zaton, etc. Most likely you'll enjoy the most in the center of the city. If you need to go shopping look no further and go to \"Gallery Krasnodar\" - a huge shopping mall where you can eat, go to movies (in Russian of course, no subtitles) or shop for groceries. Uber is widely used there, although it's operating under the brand Yandex.Taxi nowadays, so you might rather use that service in Russia. Overall, a good city to live in and not expensive. If you want to eat cheap go to a small family-restaurants. Air is quite polluted, unfortunately. Driving also not recommended. Streets are narrow and driving is chaotic. If you want something nearby the sea consider Sochi - it's a bit more expensive, but more developed for foreigners, I think. ",

The old town is really beautiful, the nightlife is also great. Can't remember the last time I had such a good nightlife experience, the bars and clubs are at a high level. Overall everyday people are friendly and nice to talk, however, about 50 percent don't speak English. I was lucky that I know some Russian, in some places which are highly rated even staff couldn't understand a word in English. The place is worth a visit, but have a precaution at all times, as scams are happening, especially at restaurants and bars for the foreigners. While I visited the strategy was to go to the places which only have really high ratings in trip advisor, so by doing that I avoided places that might scam, and the experience overall was good. If the place from the foreigns is not rated highly enough, just better be safe and plan in advance where to go. I tried working there also, so managed to get some cozy cafes in town with decent internet.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "As a person who’s born here and knows the place well I can give some valuable tips and share a biased view 😄 The city and people are great if you know how to navigate it. If you don’t know, it’s a big problem. Have an advice from the local, it’s important ⚠️ You should have a key for great experience in Kharkiv, get it! 🔑 WHY KHARKIV? Cool, well-educated people with own opinion, business-minded, direct. You’ll not find old historical buildings here the city was rebuilt ground up after WW2. The city is managed better than any other Ukrainian city, it’s clean. Not soviet in it’s heart ❤️  WHERE TO BE? Draw a triangle between Gor Kafe 1654 (tip), Otakara Yarosha st. (bottom). Rent there, live there, walk there, party there 😎 WHERE I LIKE TO WALK 1) Gorky Park, 2) Sarzhyn Yar (subway station Botanical Garden), 3) Pushkinskaya str. + around NTU “KHPI”, 4) Sumskaya + Rymarskaya. TAXI ONLY right now ON Taxi app with business class cars is the best and rather cheap, Uber and Bolt are so-so. HOTEL ONLY I’d not rent an apartment as prices aren’t fair (you can get a lot of money if you rent your apartment 10-15% a year 😉) rather look for a modern hotel like: 4 rooms and villa 4 rooms, Cosmopolit, Mirax, etc. normal Eastern European prices, rooms are spacious. DON’T WORRY it’s a safe place to be. I was never robbed or attacked even in scary 90-s, walking alone around dark, grotesque post-soviet haunted houses or empty streets, np at all. Locals love tourists and will help when they can, if you lost and people around don’t know English, you’ll soon find someone who’ll guide you, give you money and a good advice. People here are proud of the place and want others to know it. Good luck, see you here!",

There's also the walled (with several different entrances) ancient, warren-like, oval-shaped city, which is about a mile across with lots of markets, small hotels and restaurants. I hear post-war Damascus, unlike Aleppo, is fairly intact. ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Spent a month in Belarus this July - we have some good friends there we work with so it was an excellent time.  Some good restaurants.  People are extremely friendly, just gotta adapt to the culture a bit.  Most seemed to be very interested in the fact that I was American.  Felt kind of like the country is just starting to open up and it will be of more international interest in the upcoming 5 - 10 years.  English is spoken in Minsk but probably less then in ukraine (my only other former soviet point of comparison).    For entertainment, there's not much going on during the week but Zbitskaya street friday and saturday has bars overflowing into the streets during the summer time.  It was a bit more expensive then I was expecting but I didn't really try to hustle for the best apartment rates.   There's a bit of bureaucracy when it comes to renting an apartment, as a foreigner on a visa I had to notify the government of my whereabouts.  I changed apartments and this resulted in me, my friend (who speaks russian) and the new landlord having to spend half a day at a government office updating them.  I believe hotels can manage all this in the background for you so if I were to go back I would just get a hotel for the whole stay. ",

If you clicked here because you're a seasoned traveler coming in with eyes wide open that Ethiopia is (very) poor but the experience and empathy to make it work in order to have an amazing travel experience: you can make it work. Ethiopia is the most foreign experience I have ever felt coming from a Western perspective. Nonetheless there are still loads of cafes, food is amazing (though you will get sick at least once), I was getting 25mbps on my phone, weather is good, everyday life is cheap. Modern apartment blocks are going up like crazy, but from a low base so housing can still be relatively expensive for what you get. It's enough to give you a home base to explore other areas of the country (which are insane travel experiences), and there is a young professional/expat scene to engage with when the rest of the city is overbearing. Granted, I spent only a week in Addis but have made good friends with a small group of locals/expats who had good insights, and have spent several years in Africa. The security issues in the rest of the country affect the vibe a lot, so it's tough to plan going there, but if that gets resolved I would recommend it for (very) adventurous travelers because the payoff in terms of experience is there.",

In rainy season, temperature drops under 30 and air quality becomes just terrible, leaving a window open will leave your floor black. Lots of places to rent, but very hard to close a long term rent deal due to landlords unwilling to close a deal remotely (cash only). Long term rentals are much more affordable than airbnb.",

I don't think this is because of the language barrier but...I cant explain this well. anyway, the city is great to stay from Jun - July(Aug starts getting rains.), would be much nicer if you can speak Russian.

Every day there are at least 2 festivals, 3 major concerts and tons of shows in theaters. The best season is winter and summer. The amount of decorations in the winter is incomparable (to London for example)! Snow adds magic to the city and if you are worried about the cold, there are plenty of shops with high quality winter clothes at decent prices. The city is very big, it will take ages to get somewhere and back, so only about 2 activities a day unless you live close.",
